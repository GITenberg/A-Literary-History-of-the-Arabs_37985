<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p><i>A Literary History of the Arabs</i>, published by T. Fisher Unwin
in 1907 and twice re-issued without alteration, now appears
under new auspices, and I wish to thank the Syndics of the
Cambridge University Press for the opportunity they have given
me of making it in some respects more accurate and useful than
it has hitherto been. Since the present edition is printed from
the original plates, there could be no question of revising the
book throughout and recasting it where necessary; but while
only a few pages have been rewritten, the Bibliography has been
brought up to date and I have removed several mistakes from
the text and corrected others in an appendix which includes a
certain amount of supplementary matter. As stated in the
preface to the first edition, I hoped "to compile a work which
should serve as a general introduction to the subject, and which
should be neither too popular for students nor too scientific for
ordinary readers. It has been my chief aim to sketch in broad
outlines what the Arabs thought, and to indicate as far as possible
the influences which moulded their thought.... Experience has
convinced me that young students of Arabic, to whom this
volume is principally addressed, often find difficulty in understanding
what they read, since they are not in touch with the
political, intellectual, and religious notions which are presented
to them. The pages of almost every Arabic book abound in
allusions to names, events, movements, and ideas of which
Moslems require no explanation, but which puzzle the Western
reader unless he have some general knowledge of Arabian
history in the widest meaning of the word. Such a survey is
not to be found, I believe, in any single European book; and if
mine supply the want, however partially and inadequately, I
<span class='pagenum'>x</span>
shall feel that my labour has been amply rewarded.... As regards
the choice of topics, I agree with the author of a famous
anthology who declares that it is harder to select than compose
(<i>ikhtiy&aacute;ru &#8217;l-kal&aacute;m a&#7779;&#8216;abu min ta&#8217;l&iacute;fihi</i>). Perhaps an epitomist
may be excused for not doing equal justice all round. To me
the literary side of the subject appeals more than the historical,
and I have followed my bent without hesitation; for in order to
interest others a writer must first be interested himself.... Considering
the importance of Arabic poetry as, in the main,
a true mirror of Arabian life, I do not think the space devoted
to it is excessive. Other branches of literature could not receive
the same attention. Many an eminent writer has been dismissed
in a few lines, many well-known names have been passed over.
But, as before said, this work is a sketch of ideas in their historical
environment rather than a record of authors, books, and dates.
The exact transliteration of Arabic words, though superfluous for
scholars and for persons entirely ignorant of the language, is an
almost indispensable aid to the class of readers whom I have
especially in view. My system is that recommended by the
Royal Asiatic Society and adopted by Professor Browne in his
<i>Literary History of Persia</i>; but I use &#7827; for the letter which he
denotes by <i>dh</i>. The definite article <i>al</i>, which is frequently
omitted at the beginning of proper names, has been restored in
the Index. It may save trouble if I mention here the abbreviations
'b.' for 'ibn' (son of); J.R.A.S. for <i>Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society</i>; Z.D.M.G. for <i>Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;ndischen
Gesellschaft</i>; and S.B.W.A. for <i>Sitzungsberichte der
Wiener Akademie</i>. Finally, it behoves me to make full acknowledgment
of my debt to the learned Orientalists whose works
I have studied and freely 'conveyed' into these pages. References
could not be given in every case, but the reader will see for
himself how much is derived from Von Kremer, Goldziher,
N&ouml;ldeke, and Wellhausen, to mention only a few of the leading
authorities. At the same time I have constantly gone back to
the native sources of information."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>xi</span></p>

<p>There remains an acknowledgment of a more personal kind.
Twenty-two years ago I wrote&mdash;"my warmest thanks are
due to my friend and colleague, Professor A. A. Bevan, who
read the proofs throughout and made a number of valuable
remarks which will be found in the footnotes." Happily the
present occasion permits me to renew those ties between us;
and the book which he helped into the world now celebrates
its majority by associating itself with his name.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Arabs belong to the great family of nations which on
account of their supposed descent from Shem, the son of
Noah, are commonly known as the 'Semites.'<span class="sidenote"> The Semites.</span>
This term includes the Babylonians and Assyrians,
the Hebrews, the Ph&oelig;nicians, the Aram&aelig;ans, the Abyssinians,
the Sab&aelig;ans, and the Arabs, and although based on a classification
that is not ethnologically precise&mdash;the Ph&oelig;nicians and
Sab&aelig;ans, for example, being reckoned in Genesis, chap. x,
among the descendants of Ham&mdash;it was well chosen by Eichhorn
(&#8224;&nbsp;1827) to comprehend the closely allied peoples which
have been named. Whether the original home of the undivided
Semitic race was some part of Asia (Arabia, Armenia, or the
district of the Lower Euphrates), or whether, according to a
view which has lately found favour, the Semites crossed
into Asia from Africa,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is still uncertain. Long before the
epoch when they first appear in history they had branched
off from the parent stock and formed separate nationalities.
The relation of the Semitic languages to each other cannot
be discussed here, but we may arrange them in the chronological
order of the extant literature as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>xvi</span></p>

<p>1. Babylonian or Assyrian (3000-500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).</p>

<p>2. Hebrew (from 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).</p>

<p>3. South Arabic, otherwise called Sab&aelig;an or &#7716;imyarite
(inscriptions from 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).</p>

<p>4. Aramaic (inscriptions from 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).</p>

<p>7. Arabic (from 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Arabic is thus, in a sense, the youngest
of the Semitic languages, it is generally allowed to be nearer
akin than any of them to the original archetype, the
'Ursemitisch,' from which they all are derived, just as
the Arabs, by reason of their geographical situation and the
monotonous uniformity of desert life, have in some respects
preserved the Semitic character more purely and exhibited it
more distinctly than any people of the same family. From
the period of the great Moslem conquests (700 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) to the
present day they have extended their language, <span class="sidenote"> The Arabs as
representatives

religion, and culture over an enormous expanse
of territory, far surpassing that of all the ancient
Semitic empires added together. It is true that
the Arabs are no longer what they were in the Middle Ages,
the ruling nation of the world, but loss of temporal power
has only strengthened their spiritual dominion. Islam still
reigns supreme in Western Asia; in Africa it has steadily
advanced; even on European soil it has found in Turkey
compensation for its banishment from Spain and Sicily.
While most of the Semitic peoples have vanished, leaving but
a meagre and ambiguous record, so that we cannot hope to
become intimately acquainted with them, we possess in the
<span class='pagenum'>xvii</span>case of the Arabs ample materials for studying almost every
phase of their development since the sixth century of the
Christian era, and for writing the whole history of their
national life and thought. This book, I need hardly say,
makes no such pretensions. Even were the space at
my disposal unlimited, a long time must elapse before
the vast and various field of Arabic literature can be
thoroughly explored and the results rendered accessible to
the historian.</p>

<p>From time immemorial Arabia was divided into North and
South, not only by the trackless desert (<i>al-Rub&#8216; al-Kh&aacute;l&iacute;</i>, the
'Solitary Quarter') which stretches across the <span class="sidenote"> Arabs of the
North and South.</span>
peninsula and forms a natural barrier to intercourse,
but also by the opposition of two kindred
races widely differing in their character and way of life.
Whilst the inhabitants of the northern province (the &#7716;ij&aacute;z
and the great central highland of Najd) were rude nomads
sheltering in 'houses of hair,' and ever shifting to and fro
in search of pasture for their camels, the people of Yemen
or Arabia Felix are first mentioned in history as the inheritors
of an ancient civilisation and as the owners of fabulous wealth&mdash;spices,
gold and precious stones&mdash;which ministered to the
luxury of King Solomon. The Bedouins of the North spoke
Arabic&mdash;that is to say, the language of the Pre-islamic poems
and of the Koran&mdash;whereas the southerners used a dialect
called by Mu&#7717;ammadans '&#7716;imyarite' and a peculiar script
of which the examples known to us have been discovered and
deciphered in comparatively recent times. Of these Sab&aelig;ans&mdash;to
adopt the designation given to them by Greek and
Roman geographers&mdash;more will be said presently. The
period of their bloom was drawing to a close in the early
centuries of our era, and they have faded out of history
before 600 a.d., when their northern neighbours first rise
into prominence.</p>

<p>It was, no doubt, the consciousness of this racial distinction
<span class="sidenote"> Ishmaelites and Yoq&#7789;&aacute;nids.</span>
<span class='pagenum'>xviii</span>that caused the view to prevail among Moslem genealogists
that the Arabs followed two separate lines of descent from
their common ancestor, S&aacute;m b. N&uacute;&#7717; (Shem,
the son of Noah). As regards those of the
North, their derivation from &#8216;Adn&aacute;n, a descendant
of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l (Ishmael) was universally recognised; those
of the South were traced back to Qa&#7717;&#7789;&aacute;n, whom most
genealogists identified with Yoq&#7789;&aacute;n (Joktan), the son of &#8216;&Aacute;bir
(Eber). Under the Yoq&#7789;&aacute;nids, who are the elder line, we
find, together with the Sab&aelig;ans and &#7716;imyarites, several large
and powerful tribes&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, &#7788;ayyi&#8217;, Kinda, and Tan&uacute;kh&mdash;which
had settled in North and Central Arabia long before
Islam, and were in no respect distinguishable from the
Bedouins of Ishmaelite origin. As to &#8216;Adn&aacute;n, his exact
genealogy is disputed, but all agree that he was of the
posterity of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l (Ishmael), the son of Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m (Abraham)
by H&aacute;jar (Hagar). The story runs that on the birth of
Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l God commanded Abraham to journey to Mecca with
Hagar and her son and to leave them there. They were seen
by some Jurhumites, descendants of Yoq&#7789;&aacute;n, who took pity
on them and resolved to settle beside them. Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l grew up
with the sons of the strangers, learned to shoot the bow, and
spoke their tongue. Then he asked of them in marriage,
and they married him to one of their women.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The tables
on the opposite page show the principal branches of the

<p><span class='pagenum'>xx</span>It is undeniable that these lineages are to some extent
fictitious. There was no Pre-islamic science of genealogy,

Thus their study of the Koran <span class="sidenote"> Character of
Mu&#7717;ammadan

and of Biblical history led to the introduction
of the patriarchs who stand at the head of their lists. Nor
can we accept the national genealogy beginning with &#8216;Adn&aacute;n
as entirely historical, though a great deal of it was actually
stored in the memories of the Arabs at the time when Islam
arose, and is corroborated by the testimony of the Pre-islamic
poets.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> On the other hand, the alleged descent of every

of the South, corresponding to the fierce hostility which
has always divided them since the earliest days of Islam,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
may hold good if we restrict the term 'Yemenite'
(Southern) to the civilised Sab&aelig;ans, &#7716;imyarites, &amp;c., who
dwelt in Yemen and spoke their own dialect, but
can hardly apply to the Arabic-speaking 'Yemenite'
Bedouins scattered all over the peninsula. Such criticism,
however, does not affect the value of the genealogical
documents regarded as an index of the popular mind. From
this point of view legend is often superior to fact, and it
must be our aim in the following chapters to set forth what
<span class='pagenum'>xxi</span>the Arabs believed rather than to examine whether or no
they were justified in believing it.</p>

<p>'Arabic,' in its widest signification, has two principal
dialects:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. South Arabic, spoken in Yemen and including Sab&aelig;an,
&#7716;imyarite, Min&aelig;an, with the kindred dialects of Mahra
and Shi&#7717;r.</p>

<p>2. Arabic proper, spoken in Arabia generally, exclusive
of Yemen.</p>

<p>Of the former language, leaving Mahr&iacute;, Socotr&iacute;, and other
living dialects out of account, we possess nothing beyond the
numerous inscriptions which have been collected <span class="sidenote"> South Arabic.</span>
by European travellers and which it will be convenient
to discuss in the next chapter, where I shall give
a brief sketch of the legendary history of the Sab&aelig;ans and
&#7716;imyarites. South Arabic resembles Arabic in its grammatical
forms, <i>e.g.</i>, the broken plural, the sign of the dual, and
the manner of denoting indefiniteness by an affixed <i>m</i> (for
which Arabic substitutes <i>n</i>) as well as in its vocabulary; its
alphabet, which consists of twenty-nine letters, <i>Sin</i> and <i>Samech</i>
being distinguished as in Hebrew, is more nearly akin to the
&AElig;thiopic. The &#7716;imyarite Empire was overthrown by the
Abyssinians in the sixth century after Christ, and by 600 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
South Arabic had become a dead language. From this time
forward the dialect of the North established an almost
universal supremacy and won for itself the title of 'Arabic'
<i>par excellence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The oldest monuments of written Arabic are modern in
date compared with the Sab&aelig;an inscriptions, some of which
take us back 2,500 years or thereabout. Apart <span class="sidenote"> The oldest
specimens of
Arabic writing.</span>
from the inscriptions of &#7716;ijr in the northern
&#7716;ij&aacute;z, and those of &#7778;af&aacute; in the neighbourhood of
Damascus (which, although written by northern Arabs before
the Christian era, exhibit a peculiar character not unlike the
<span class='pagenum'>xxii</span>Sab&aelig;an and cannot be called Arabic in the usual acceptation
of the term), the most ancient examples of Arabic writing
which have hitherto been discovered appear in the trilingual
(Syriac, Greek, and Arabic) inscription of Zabad,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> south-east of
Aleppo, dated 512 or 513 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and the bilingual (Greek and
Arabic) of &#7716;arr&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> dated 568 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> With these documents we
need not concern ourselves further, especially as their
interpretation presents great difficulties. Very few among
the Pre-islamic Arabs were able to read or write.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Those who
could generally owed their skill to Jewish and Christian
teachers, or to the influence of foreign culture radiating
from &#7716;&iacute;ra and Ghass&aacute;n. But although the Koran, which
was first collected soon after the battle of Yam&aacute;ma (633
a.d.), is the oldest Arabic book, the beginnings of literary
composition in the Arabic language can be traced back to
an earlier period. Probably all the Pre-islamic poems which
have come down to us belong to the century preceding
Islam (500-622 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), but their elaborate form and technical
perfection forbid the hypothesis that in them we have "the
first sprightly runnings" of Arabian song. It may be said of
these magnificent odes, as of the Iliad and <span class="sidenote"> The Pre-islamic
poems.</span>
Odyssey, that "they are works of highly finished
art, which could not possibly have been produced
until the poetical art had been practised for a long time."
They were preserved during hundreds of years by oral tradition,
as we shall explain elsewhere, and were committed to writing,
for the most part, by the Moslem scholars of the early
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid age, <i>i.e.</i>, between 750 and 900 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> It is a noteworthy
fact that the language of these poems, the authors of
which represent many different tribes and districts of the
<span class='pagenum'>xxiii</span>peninsula, is one and the same. The dialectical variations
are too trivial to be taken into account. We might conclude
that the poets used an artificial dialect, not such as was
commonly spoken but resembling the epic dialect of Ionia
which was borrowed by Dorian and &AElig;olian bards. When
we find, however, that the language in question is employed
not only by the wandering troubadours, who were often men
of some culture, and the Christian Arabs of &#7716;&iacute;ra on the
Euphrates, but also by goat-herds, brigands, and illiterate
Bedouins of every description, there can be no room for doubt
that in the poetry of the sixth century we hear the Arabic
language as it was then spoken throughout the length and
breadth of Arabia. The success of Mu&#7717;ammad and the
conquests made by Islam under the Orthodox Caliphs gave
an entirely new importance to this classical idiom. Arabic
became the sacred language of the whole Moslem world.
This was certainly due to the Koran; but, on <span class="sidenote"> The Koran.</span>
the other hand, to regard the dialect of Mecca,
in which the Koran is written, as the source and prototype
of the Arabic language, and to call Arabic 'the dialect of
Quraysh,' is utterly to reverse the true facts of the case.
Mu&#7717;ammad, as N&ouml;ldeke has observed, took the ancient poetry
for a model; and in the early age of Islam it was the authority
of the heathen poets (of whom Quraysh had singularly few)
that determined the classical usage and set the standard of
correct speech. Moslems, who held the Koran to be the
Word of God and inimitable in point of style, naturally
exalted the dialect of the Prophet's tribe above all others, even
laying down the rule that every tribe spoke less purely in
proportion to its distance from Mecca, but this view will not
commend itself to the unprejudiced student. The Koran,
however, exercised a unique influence on the history of the
Arabic language and literature. We shall see in a subsequent
chapter that the necessity of preserving the text of the Holy
Book uncorrupted, and of elucidating its obscurities, caused
<span class='pagenum'>xxiv</span>the Moslems to invent a science of grammar and lexicography,
and to collect the old Pre-Mu&#7717;ammadan poetry and traditions
which must otherwise have perished. When the Arabs
settled as conquerors in Syria and Persia and mixed with
foreign peoples, the purity of the classical language could no
longer be maintained. While in Arabia itself, especially
among the nomads of the desert, little difference was felt,
in the provincial garrison towns and great centres of industry
like Ba&#7779;ra and K&uacute;fa, where the population largely consisted
of aliens who had embraced Islam and were rapidly being
Arabicised, the door stood open for all sorts of depravation
to creep in. Against this vulgar Arabic the <span class="sidenote"> Arabic in the
Mu&#7717;ammadan
Empire.</span>
philologists waged unrelenting war, and it was
mainly through their exertions that the classical
idiom triumphed over the dangers to which it was exposed.
Although the language of the pagan Bedouins did not survive
intact&mdash;or survived, at any rate, only in the mouths of pedants
and poets&mdash;it became, in a modified form, the universal
medium of expression among the upper classes of Mu&#7717;ammadan
society. During the early Middle Ages it was spoken
and written by all cultivated Moslems, of whatever nationality
they might be, from the Indus to the Atlantic; it was the
language of the Court and the Church, of Law and
Commerce, of Diplomacy and Literature and Science. When
the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century swept away the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphate, and therewith the last vestige of political
unity in Islam, classical Arabic ceased to be the &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#942; or
'common dialect' of the Moslem world, and was supplanted
in Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and other Arabic-speaking countries
by a vulgar colloquial idiom. In these countries, however, it
is still the language of business, literature, and education, and
we are told on high authority that even now it "is undergoing
a renaissance, and there is every likelihood of its again
becoming a great literary vehicle."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> And if, for those
<span class='pagenum'>xxv</span>Moslems who are not Arabs, it occupies relatively much
the same position as Latin and Greek in modern European
culture, we must not forget that the Koran, its most
renowned masterpiece, is learned by every Moslem when
he first goes to school, is repeated in his daily prayers, and
influences the whole course of his life to an extent which the
ordinary Christian can hardly realise.</p>

<p>I hope that I may be excused for ignoring in a work
such as this the information regarding Ancient Arabian history
which it is possible to glean from the Babylonian and Assyrian
monuments. Any sketch that might be drawn of the Arabs, say
from 2500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to the beginning of our era, would resemble a
map of Cathay delineated by Sir John Mandeville. But amongst
the shadowy peoples of the peninsula one, besides Saba and
&#7716;imyar, makes something more than a transient impression.
The Naba&#7789;&aelig;ans (<i>Naba&#7789;</i>, pl. <i>Anb&aacute;&#7789;</i>) dwelt in towns, drove a
flourishing trade long before the birth of Christ, and founded
the kingdom of Petra, which attained a high <span class="sidenote"> The Naba&#7789;&aelig;ans.</span>
degree of prosperity and culture until it was
annexed by Trajan in 105 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> These Naba&#7789;&aelig;ans were
Arabs and spoke Arabic, although in default of a script of their
own they used Aramaic for writing.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Mu&#7717;ammadan authors
identify them with the Aram&aelig;ans, but careful study of their
inscriptions has shown that this view, which was accepted by
Quatrem&egrave;re,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> is erroneous. 'The Book of Naba&#7789;&aelig;an Agriculture'
(<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Fal&aacute;&#7717;at al-Naha&#7789;iyya</i>), composed in 904 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
by the Moslem Ibnu &#8217;l-Wa&#7717;shiyya, who professed to have
translated it from the Chald&aelig;an, is now known to be a forgery.
I only mention it here as an instance of the way in which
Moslems apply the term 'Naba&#7789;&aelig;an'; for the title in question
does not, of course, refer to Petra but to Babylon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>xxvi</span>From what has been said the reader will perceive that the
<span class="sidenote"> Three periods of

is derived from Arabic sources, may be divided

and extending to the present day.</p></td>

</table>

<p>For the first period, which is confined to the history of Yemen
or South Arabia, we have no contemporary Arabic sources except
the inscriptions. The valuable but imperfect <span class="sidenote"> The Sab&aelig;ans and
&#7716;imyarites.</span>
information which these supply is appreciably
increased by the traditions preserved in the Pre-islamic
poems, in the Koran, and particularly in the later
Mu&#7717;ammadan literature. It is true that most of this material
is legendary and would justly be ignored by any one engaged
in historical research, but I shall nevertheless devote a
good deal of space to it, since my principal object is to make
known the beliefs and opinions of the Arabs themselves.</p>

<p>The second period is called by Mu&#7717;ammadan writers the
<i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the Age of Ignorance or Barbarism.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Its
characteristics are faithfully and vividly reflected
in the songs and odes of the heathen poets which <span class="sidenote"> The pagan
Arabs.</span>
have come down to us. There was no prose
literature at that time: it was the poet's privilege to sing the
history of his own people, to record their genealogies, to celebrate
their feats of arms, and to extol their virtues. Although
an immense quantity of Pre-islamic verse has been lost for ever,
<span class='pagenum'>xxvii</span>we still possess a considerable remnant, which, together with
the prose narratives compiled by Moslem philologists and
antiquaries, enables us to picture the life of those wild days,
in its larger aspects, accurately enough.</p>

<p>The last and by far the most important of the three periods
comprises the history of the Arabs under Islam. It falls
naturally into the following sections, which are <span class="sidenote"> The Moslem
Arabs.</span>
enumerated in this place in order that the reader
may see at a glance the broad political outlines
of the complex and difficult epoch which lies before him.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>A.</i> The Life of Mu&#7717;ammad.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the seventh century of the Christian
era a man named Mu&#7717;ammad, son of &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h, of the tribe
Quraysh, appeared in Mecca with a Divine <span class="sidenote"> Life of
Mu&#7717;ammad.</span>
revelation (Koran). He called on his fellow-townsmen
to renounce idolatry and worship the
One God. In spite of ridicule and persecution he continued
for several years to preach the religion of Islam in Mecca, but,
making little progress there, he fled in 622 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> to the neighbouring
city of Med&iacute;na. From this date his cause prospered
exceedingly. During the next decade the whole of Arabia
submitted to his rule and did lip-service at least to the new
Faith.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>B.</i> The Orthodox Caliphate (632-661 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>On the death of the Prophet the Moslems were governed
in turn by four of the most eminent among his Companions&mdash;Ab&uacute;
Bakr, &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n, and &#8216;Al&iacute;&mdash;who bore <span class="sidenote"> The Orthodox
Caliphs.</span>
the title of <i>Khal&iacute;fa</i> (Caliph), <i>i.e.</i>, Vicegerent, and
are commonly described as the Orthodox Caliphs
(<i>al-Khulaf&aacute; al-R&aacute;shid&uacute;n</i>). Under their guidance Islam was
firmly established in the peninsula and was spread far beyond
its borders. Hosts of Bedouins settled as military colonists in
the fertile plains of Syria and Persia. Soon, however, the
<span class='pagenum'>xxviii</span>recently founded empire was plunged into civil war. The
murder of &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n gave the signal for a bloody strife between
rival claimants of the Caliphate. &#8216;Al&iacute;, the son-in-law of the
Prophet, assumed the title, but his election was contested by
the powerful governor of Syria, Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya b. Ab&iacute; Sufy&aacute;n.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>C.</i> The Umayyad Dynasty (661-750 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>&#8216;Al&iacute; fell by an assassin's dagger, and Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya succeeded to
the Caliphate, which remained in his family for ninety years.
The Umayyads, with a single exception, were <span class="sidenote"> The Umayyad
dynasty.</span>
Arabs first and Moslems afterwards. Religion
sat very lightly on them, but they produced some
able and energetic princes, worthy leaders of an imperial race.
By 732 a.d. the Moslem conquests had reached the utmost
limit which they ever attained. The Caliph in Damascus had
his lieutenants beyond the Oxus and the Pyrenees, on the shores
of the Caspian and in the valley of the Nile. Meantime the
strength of the dynasty was being sapped by political and
religious dissensions nearer home. The Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, who held that
the Caliphate belonged by Divine right to &#8216;Al&iacute; and his descendants,
rose in revolt again and again. They were joined
by the Persian Moslems, who loathed the Arabs and the
oppressive Umayyad government. The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids, a family
closely related to the Prophet, put themselves at the head of
the agitation. It ended in the complete overthrow of the
reigning house, which was almost exterminated.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>D.</i> The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Dynasty (750-1258 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>Hitherto the Arabs had played a dominant r&ocirc;le in the
Moslem community, and had treated the non-Arab Moslems
with exasperating contempt. Now the tables were <span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
dynasty.</span>turned. We pass from the period of Arabian
nationalism to one of Persian ascendancy and
cosmopolitan culture. The flower of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid troops
were Persians from Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n; Baghd&aacute;d, the wonderful
<span class='pagenum'>xxix</span>&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid capital, was built on Persian soil; and Persian nobles
filled the highest offices of state at the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid court. The
new dynasty, if not religious, was at least favourable to
religion, and took care to live in the odour of sanctity. For a
time Arabs and Persians forgot their differences and worked
together as good Moslems ought. Piety was no longer its
own reward. Learning enjoyed munificent patronage. This
was the Golden Age of Islam, which culminated in the glorious
reign of H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d (786-809 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). On his death
peace was broken once more, and the mighty empire began
slowly to collapse. As province after province cut itself loose
from the Caliphate, numerous independent dynasties sprang up,
while the Caliphs became helpless puppets in the hands of
Turkish mercenaries. Their authority was still formally
recognised in most Mu&#7717;ammadan countries, but since the
middle of the ninth century they had little or no real
power.</p>

<p><i>E.</i> From the Mongol invasion to the present day (1258
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&mdash;).</p>

<p>The Mongol hordes under H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute; captured Baghd&aacute;d in
1258 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> and made an end of the Caliphate. Sweeping
onward, they were checked by the Egyptian <span class="sidenote"> The Post-Mongolian
period.</span>
Mamelukes and retired into Persia, where, some
fifty years afterwards, they embraced Islam. The
successors of H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;, the &Iacute;l-kh&aacute;ns, reigned in Persia until a
second wave of barbarians under T&iacute;m&uacute;r spread devastation and
anarchy through Western Asia (1380-1405 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The unity
of Islam, in a political sense, was now destroyed. Out of the
chaos three Mu&#7717;ammadan empires gradually took shape. In
1358 the Ottoman Turks crossed the Hellespont, in 1453
they entered Constantinople, and in 1517 Syria, Egypt, and
Arabia were added to their dominions. Persia became an
independent kingdom under the &#7778;afawids (1502-1736); while
in India the empire of the Great Moguls was founded by B&aacute;bur,
<span class='pagenum'>xxx</span>a descendant of T&iacute;m&uacute;r, and gloriously maintained by his
successors, Akbar and Awrangz&iacute;b (1525-1707).</p>

<p>Some of the political events which have been summarised
above will be treated more fully in the body of this work;
others will receive no more than a passing notice.
The ideas which reveal themselves in Arabic <span class="sidenote"> Arabian literary
history.</span>
literature are so intimately connected with the
history of the people, and so incomprehensible apart from the
external circumstances in which they arose, that I have found
myself obliged to dwell at considerable length on various
matters of historical interest, in order to bring out what is really
characteristic and important from our special point of view.
The space devoted to the early periods (500-750 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) will not
appear excessive if they are seen in their true light as the
centre and heart of Arabian history. During the next hundred
years Moslem civilisation reaches its zenith, but the Arabs
recede more and more into the background. The Mongol
invasion virtually obliterated their national life, though in
Syria and Egypt they maintained their traditions of culture
under Turkish rule, and in Spain we meet them struggling
desperately against Christendom. Many centuries earlier, in
the palmy days of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Empire, the Arabs <i>pur sang</i> contributed
only a comparatively small share to the literature
which bears their name. I have not, however, enforced the
test of nationality so strictly as to exclude all foreigners or
men of mixed origin who wrote in Arabic. It may be said
that the work of Persians (who even nowadays <span class="sidenote"> Writers who are
wholly or partly
of foreign extraction.</span>
are accustomed to use Arabic when writing on
theological and philosophical subjects) cannot
illustrate the history of Arabian thought, but
only the influence exerted upon Arabian thought by Persian
ideas, and that consequently it must stand aside unless admitted
for this definite purpose. But what shall we do in the case of
those numerous and celebrated authors who are neither wholly
<span class='pagenum'>xxxi</span>Arab nor wholly Persian, but unite the blood of both races?
Must we scrutinise their genealogies and try to discover which
strain preponderates? That would be a tedious and unprofitable
task. The truth is that after the Umayyad period no
hard-and-fast line can be drawn between the native and foreign
elements in Arabic literature. Each reacted on the other, and
often both are combined indissolubly. Although they must be
distinguished as far as possible, we should be taking a narrow
and pedantic view of literary history if we insisted on regarding
them as mutually exclusive.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>

<h5>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</h5>

<p>With the Sab&aelig;ans Arabian history in the proper sense may
be said to begin, but as a preliminary step we must take
account of certain races which figure more or less <span class="sidenote"> Primitive
races.</span>
prominently in legend, and are considered by
Moslem chroniclers to have been the original
inhabitants of the country. Among these are the peoples of
&#8216;&Aacute;d and Tham&uacute;d, which are constantly held up in the Koran
as terrible examples of the pride that goeth before destruction.
The home of the &#8216;&Aacute;dites was in &#7716;a&#7693;ramawt, the province
adjoining Yemen, on the borders of the desert named <i>A&#7717;q&aacute;fu
&#8217;l'Raml</i>. It is doubtful whether they were Semites, possibly
of Aramaic descent, who were subdued and exterminated by
invaders from the north, or, as Hommel maintains,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> the
representatives of an imposing non-Semitic <span class="sidenote">Legend of &#8216;Ad.</span>culture which survives in the tradition of
'Many-columned Iram,'<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> the Earthly Paradise built by
Shadd&aacute;d, one of their kings. The story of their destruction
is related as follows:<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> They were a people of gigantic
strength and stature, worshipping idols and committing all
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_2" id="Page_2" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>2</a></span>
manner of wrong; and when God sent to them a prophet,
H&uacute;d by name, who should warn them to repent, they
answered: "O H&uacute;d, thou hast brought us no evidence,
and we will not abandon our gods for thy saying, nor will we
believe in thee. We say one of our gods hath afflicted thee
with madness."<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Then a fearful drought fell upon the land
of &#8216;&Aacute;d, so that they sent a number of their chief men to
Mecca to pray for rain. On arriving at Mecca the envoys
were hospitably received by the Amalekite prince, Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya
b. Bakr, who entertained them with wine and music&mdash;for he
had two famous singing-girls known as <i>al-Jar&aacute;dat&aacute;n</i>; which
induced them to neglect their mission for the space of a whole
month. At last, however, they got to business, and their
spokesman had scarce finished his prayer when three clouds
appeared, of different colours&mdash;white, red, and black&mdash;and a
voice cried from heaven, "Choose for thyself and for thy
people!" He chose the black cloud, deeming that it had the
greatest store of rain, whereupon the voice chanted&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thou hast chosen embers dun | that will spare of &#8216;&Aacute;d not one |
that will leave nor father nor son | ere him to death they shall have
done."</p></div>

<p>Then God drove the cloud until it stood over the land of &#8216;&Aacute;d,
and there issued from it a roaring wind that consumed the
whole people except a few who had taken the prophet's
warning to heart and had renounced idolatry.</p>

<p>From these, in course of time, a new people arose, who are
called 'the second &#8216;&Aacute;d.' They had their settlements in
Yemen, in the region of Saba. The building of the great
Dyke of Ma&#8217;rib is commonly attributed to their king,
Luqm&aacute;n b. &#8216;&Aacute;d, about whom many fables are told. He was
surnamed 'The Man of the Vultures' (<i>Dhu &#8217;l-Nus&uacute;r</i>),
because it had been granted to him that he should live as
long as seven vultures, one after the other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_3" id="Page_3" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGEND OF &#8216;&Aacute;D AND THAM&Uacute;D</i></span>3</a></span>

In North Arabia, between the &#7716;ij&aacute;z and Syria, dwelt the
kindred race of Tham&uacute;d, described in the Koran (vii, 72) as
inhabiting houses which they cut for themselves <span class="sidenote">Legend of
Tham&uacute;d.</span>
in the rocks. Evidently Mu&#7717;ammad did not
know the true nature of the hewn chambers
which are still to be seen at &#7716;ijr (Mad&aacute;&#8217;in &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;), a week's
journey northward from Med&iacute;na, and which are proved by
the Naba&#7789;&aelig;an inscriptions engraved on them to have been
sepulchral monuments.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Tham&uacute;d sinned in the same way
as &#8216;&Aacute;d, and suffered a like fate. They scouted the prophet
&#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;, refusing to believe in him unless he should work a
miracle. &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; then caused a she-camel big with young to come
forth from a rock, and bade them do her no hurt, but one of
the miscreants, Qud&aacute;r the Red (al-A&#7717;mar), hamstrung and
killed her. "Whereupon a great earthquake overtook them
with a noise of thunder, and in the morning they lay dead in
their houses, flat upon their breasts."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The author of this
catastrophe became a byword: Arabs say, "More unlucky
than the hamstringer of the she-camel," or "than A&#7717;mar of
Tham&uacute;d." It should be pointed out that, unlike the &#8216;&Aacute;dites,
of whom we find no trace in historical times, the Tham&uacute;dites
are mentioned as still existing by Diodorus Siculus and
Ptolemy; and they survived down to the fifth century a.d.
in the corps of <i>equites Thamudeni</i> attached to the army of the
Byzantine emperors.</p>

<p>Besides &#8216;&Aacute;d and Tham&uacute;d, the list of primitive races
includes the &#8216;Am&aacute;l&iacute;q (Amalekites)&mdash;a purely fictitious term
under which the Moslem antiquaries lumped <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Am&aacute;l&iacute;q.</span>together several peoples of an age long past,
<i>e.g.</i>, the Canaanites and the Philistines. We hear of Amalekite
settlements in the Tih&aacute;ma (Netherland) of Mecca and
in other parts of the peninsula. Finally, mention should
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>4</a></span>be made of &#7788;asm and Jad&iacute;s, sister tribes of which nothing
is recorded except the fact of their destruction and the
events that brought it about. The legendary <span class="sidenote"> &#7788;asm and Jad&iacute;s.</span>
narrative in which these are embodied has some
arch&aelig;ological interest as showing the existence in early
Arabian society of a barbarous feudal custom, 'le droit du
seigneur,' but it is time to pass on to the main subject of
this chapter.</p>

<p>The Pre-islamic history of the Yoq&#7789;&aacute;nids, or Southern
Arabs, on which we now enter, is virtually the history of <span class="sidenote"> History of the
Yoq&#7789;&aacute;nids.</span>
two peoples, the Sab&aelig;ans and the &#7716;imyarites,
who formed the successive heads of a South
Arabian empire extending from the Red Sea to
the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Saba<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> (Sheba of the Old Testament) is often incorrectly
used to denote the whole of Arabia Felix, whereas it was only
one, though doubtless the first in power and <span class="sidenote"> The Sab&aelig;ans.</span>
importance, of several kingdoms, the names and
capitals of which are set down in the works of Greek
and Roman geographers. However exaggerated may be the
glowing accounts that we find there of Sab&aelig;an wealth and
magnificence, it is certain that Saba was a flourishing commercial
state many centuries before the birth of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
"Sea-traffic between the ports of East Arabia and India was
very early established, and Indian products, especially spices
and rare animals (apes and peacocks) were conveyed to the
coast of &#8216;Um&aacute;n. Thence, apparently even in the tenth century
b.c., they went overland to the Arabian Gulf, where they
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#"><span><i>THE SAB&AElig;AN EMPIRE</i></span>5</a></span>
were shipped to Egypt for the use of the Pharaohs and
grandees.... The difficulty of navigating the Red Sea
caused the land route to be preferred for the traffic between
Yemen and Syria. From Shabwat (Sabota) in &#7716;a&#7693;ramawt
the caravan road went to Ma&#8217;rib (Mariaba), the Sab&aelig;an
capital, then northward to Macoraba (the later Mecca), and
by way of Petra to Gaza on the Mediterranean."<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The
prosperity of the Sab&aelig;ans lasted until the Indian trade,
instead of going overland, began to go by sea along the coast
of &#7716;a&#7693;ramawt and through the straits of B&aacute;b al-Mandab. In
consequence of this change, which seems to have taken place
in the first century a.d., their power gradually declined, a
great part of the population was forced to seek new homes in
the north, their cities became desolate, and their massive
aqueducts crumbled to pieces. We shall see presently that
Arabian legend has crystallised the results of a long period of
decay into a single fact&mdash;the bursting of the Dyke of Ma&#8217;rib.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the Sab&aelig;ans left the way open for a
younger branch of the same stock, namely, the &#7716;imyarites,
or, as they are called by classical authors, <span class="sidenote"> The &#7716;imyarites.</span>
Homerit&aelig;, whose country lay between Saba and
the sea. Under their kings, known as Tubba&#8216;s, they soon
became the dominant power in South Arabia and exercised
sway, at least ostensibly, over the northern tribes down to the
end of the fifth century a.d., when the latter revolted and, led
by Kulayb b. Rab&iacute;&#8216;a, shook off the suzerainty of Yemen in a
great battle at Khaz&aacute;z&aacute;.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The &#7716;imyarites never flourished like
the Sab&aelig;ans. Their maritime situation exposed them more to
attack, while the depopulation of the country had seriously
weakened their military strength. The Abyssinians&mdash;originally
colonists from Yemen&mdash;made repeated attempts to gain a
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>6</a></span>foothold, and frequently managed to instal governors who
were in turn expelled by native princes. Of these Abyssinian
viceroys the most famous is Abraha, whose unfortunate expedition
against Mecca will be related in due course. Ultimately
the &#7716;imyarite Empire was reduced to a Persian dependency.
It had ceased to exist as a political power about a hundred
years before the rise of Islam.</p>

<p>The chief Arabian sources of information concerning Saba
and &#7716;imyar are (1) the so-called '&#7716;imyarite' inscriptions, <span class="sidenote"> Sources of
information.</span>
and (2) the traditions, almost entirely of a legendary
kind, which are preserved in Mu&#7717;ammadan
literature.</p>

<p>Although the South Arabic language may have maintained
itself sporadically in certain remote districts down to the
Prophet's time or even later, it had long ago been
superseded as a medium of daily intercourse by <span class="sidenote"> The South
Arabic or
Sab&aelig;an
inscriptions.</span>
the language of the North, the Arabic <i>par
excellence</i>, which henceforth reigns without a rival
throughout the peninsula. The dead language, however, did
not wholly perish. Already in the sixth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> the
Bedouin rider made his camel kneel down while he stopped
to gaze wonderingly at inscriptions in a strange character
engraved on walls of rock or fragments of hewn stone, and
compared the mysterious, half-obliterated markings to the
almost unrecognisable traces of the camping-ground which
for him was fraught with tender memories. These inscriptions
are often mentioned by Mu&#7717;ammadan authors, who
included them in the term <i>Musnad</i>. That some Moslems&mdash;probably
very few&mdash;could not only read the South Arabic
alphabet, but were also acquainted with the elementary rules
of orthography, appears from a passage in the eighth book of
Hamd&aacute;n&iacute;'s <i>Ikl&iacute;l</i>; but though they might decipher proper
names and make out the sense of words here and there, they
had no real knowledge of the language. How the inscriptions
were discovered anew by the enterprise of European travellers,
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#"><span><i>SOUTH ARABIC INSCRIPTIONS</i></span>7</a></span>
gradually deciphered and interpreted until they became capable
of serving as a basis for historical research, and what results
the study of them has produced, this I shall now set forth as
briefly as possible. Before doing so it is necessary to explain
why instead of '&#7716;imyarite inscriptions' and '&#7716;imyarite
language' I have adopted the less familiar designations 'South
Arabic' or 'Sab&aelig;an.' '&#7716;imyarite' is equally misleading,
whether applied to the language of the inscriptions or to the
inscriptions themselves. As regards the language, it was
spoken in one form or another not by the <span class="sidenote"> Objections to
the term
'&#7716;imyarite.'</span>
&#7716;imyarites alone, but also by the Sab&aelig;ans, the
Min&aelig;ans, and all the different peoples of Yemen.
Mu&#7717;ammadans gave the name of '&#7716;imyarite' to the ancient
language of Yemen for the simple reason that the &#7716;imyarites
were the most powerful race in that country during the last
centuries preceding Islam. Had all the inscriptions belonged
to the period of &#7716;imyarite supremacy, they might with some
justice have been named after the ruling people; but the fact
is that many date from a far earlier age, some going back to
the eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, perhaps nearly a thousand years before
the &#7716;imyarite Empire was established. The term 'Sab&aelig;an'
is less open to objection, for it may fairly be regarded as a
national rather than a political denomination. On the whole,
however, I prefer 'South Arabic' to either.</p>

<p>Among the pioneers of exploration in Yemen the first to
interest himself in the discovery of inscriptions was Carsten
Niebuhr, whose <i>Beschreibung von Arabien</i>, published
in 1772, conveyed to Europe the report <span class="sidenote"> Discovery and
decipherment
of the South
Arabic
inscriptions.</span>
that inscriptions which, though he had not seen
them, he conjectured to be '&#7716;imyarite,' existed
in the ruins of the once famous city of &#7826;af&aacute;r. On one
occasion a Dutchman who had turned Mu&#7717;ammadan showed
him the copy of an inscription in a completely unknown
alphabet, but "at that time (he says) being very ill with a
violent fever, I had more reason to prepare myself for death
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>8</a></span>
than to collect old inscriptions."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Thus the opportunity was
lost, but curiosity had been awakened, and in 1810 Ulrich
Jasper Seetzen discovered and copied several inscriptions in the
neighbourhood of &#7826;af&aacute;r. Unfortunately these copies, which
had to be made hastily, were very inexact. He also purchased
an inscription, which he took away with him and copied at
leisure, but his ignorance of the characters led him to mistake
the depressions in the stone for letters, so that the conclusions
he came to were naturally of no value.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The first serviceable
copies of South Arabic inscriptions were brought to Europe by
English officers employed on the survey of the southern and
western coasts of Arabia. Lieutenant J. R. Wellsted published
the inscriptions of &#7716;i&#7779;n Ghur&aacute;b and Naqb al-&#7716;ajar in his
<i>Travels in Arabia</i> (1838).</p>

<p>Meanwhile Emil R&ouml;diger, Professor of Oriental Languages
at Halle, with the help of two manuscripts of the Berlin Royal
Library containing '&#7716;imyarite' alphabets, took the first step
towards a correct decipherment by refuting the idea, for which
De Sacy's authority had gained general acceptance, that the
South Arabic script ran from left to right<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>; he showed, moreover,
that the end of every word was marked by a straight perpendicular
line.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Wellsted's inscriptions, together with those which
Hulton and Cruttenden brought to light at &#7778;an&#8216;&aacute;, were deciphered
by Gesenius and R&ouml;diger working independently
(1841). Hitherto England and Germany had shared the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_9" id="Page_9" href="#"><span><i>SOUTH ARABIC INSCRIPTIONS</i></span>9</a></span>
credit of discovery, but a few years later France joined
hands with them and was soon leading the way with
characteristic brilliance. In 1843 Th. Arnaud, starting from
&#7778;an&#8216;&aacute;, succeeded in discovering the ruins of Ma&#8217;rib, the ancient
Sab&aelig;an metropolis, and in copying at the risk of his life
between fifty and sixty inscriptions, which were afterwards
published in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> and found an able interpreter
in Osiander.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Still more important were the results of the
expedition undertaken in 1870 by the Jewish scholar, Joseph
Hal&eacute;vy, who penetrated into the Jawf, or country lying east
of &#7778;an&#8216;&aacute;, which no European had traversed before him since
24 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when &AElig;lius Gallus led a Roman army by the same
route. After enduring great fatigues and meeting with many
perilous adventures, Hal&eacute;vy brought back copies of nearly seven
hundred inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> During the last twenty-five years much
fresh material has been collected by E. Glaser and Julius
Euting, while study of that already existing by Pr&aelig;torius,
Hal&eacute;vy, D. H. M&uuml;ller, Mordtmann, and other scholars has
substantially enlarged our knowledge of the language, history,
and religion of South Arabia in the Pre-islamic age.</p>

<p>Neither the names of the &#7716;imyarite monarchs, as they
appear in the lists drawn up by Mu&#7717;ammadan historians, nor
the order in which these names are arranged can pretend to
accuracy. If they are historical persons at all they must have
reigned in fairly recent times, perhaps a short while before the
rise of Islam, and probably they were unimportant princes
whom the legend has thrown back into the ancient epoch, and
has invested with heroic attributes. Any one who doubts this
has only to compare the modern lists with those which have
been made from the material in the inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> D. H.
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>10</a></span>
M&uuml;ller has collected the names of thirty-three Min&aelig;an kings.
Certain names are often repeated&mdash;a proof of the existence of
ruling dynasties&mdash;and ornamental epithets are <span class="sidenote"> The historical
value of
the inscriptions.</span>
usually attached to them. Thus we find Dhamar&#8216;al&iacute;
Dhirr&iacute;&#7717; (Glorious), Yatha&#8216;amar Bayyin (Distinguished),
Kariba&#8217;&iacute;l Wat&aacute;r Yuhan&#8216;im (Great, Beneficent),
Samah&#8216;al&iacute; Yan&uacute;f (Exalted). Moreover, the kings bear
different titles corresponding to three distinct periods of South
Arabian history, viz., 'Priest-king of Saba' (<i>Mukarrib Saba</i>),<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
'King of Saba' (<i>Malk Saba</i>), and 'King of Saba and Rayd&aacute;n.'
In this way it is possible to determine approximately the age of
the various buildings and inscriptions, and to show that they
do not belong, as had hitherto been generally supposed, to the
time of Christ, but that in some cases they are at least eight
hundred years older.</p>

<p>How widely the peaceful, commerce-loving people of Saba
and &#7716;imyar differed in character from the wild Arabs to
whom Mu&#7717;ammad was sent appears most strikingly <span class="sidenote"> Votive
inscriptions.</span>

and piously hopes for a continuance of favour. The dead are
conceived as living happily under divine protection; they are

<p>In concluding this very inadequate account of the South
Arabic inscriptions I must claim the indulgence of my readers,
who are aware how difficult it is to write clearly and accurately
upon any subject without first-hand knowledge, in particular
when the results of previous research are continually being
transformed by new workers in the same field.</p>

<p>Fortunately we possess a considerable literary supplement to
these somewhat austere and meagre remains. Our knowledge
of South Arabian geography, antiquities, and <span class="sidenote"> Literary
sources.</span>
legendary history is largely derived from the
works of two natives of Yemen, who were filled
with enthusiasm for its ancient glories, and whose writings,
though different as fact and fable, are from the present point
of view equally instructive&mdash;&#7716;asan b. A&#7717;mad al-Hamd&aacute;n&iacute; and

Nashw&aacute;n b. Sa&#8216;&iacute;d al-&#7716;imyar&iacute;. Besides an excellent geography
of Arabia (<i>&#7778;ifatu Jaz&iacute;rat al-&#8216;Arab</i>), which has been edited by
<span class="sidenote">Hamd&aacute;n&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;945 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>D. H. M&uuml;ller, Hamd&aacute;n&iacute; left a great work on history and antiquities of Yemen, entitled
<i>al-Ikl&iacute;l</i> ('The Crown'), and divided into ten
books under the following heads:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent2">Book I. <i>Compendium of the beginning and origins of genealogy.</i></p>

<p class="indent2">Book X. <i>Concerning the genealogy of &#7716;&aacute;shid and Bak&iacute;l</i> (the two
principal tribes of Hamd&aacute;n).</p></div>

<p>The same intense patriotism which caused Hamd&aacute;n&iacute; to devote
himself to scientific research inspired Nashw&aacute;n b. Sa&#8216;&iacute;d, who
descended on the father's side from one of the <span class="sidenote">Nashw&aacute;n b.
Sa&#8216;&iacute;d

(&#8224;&nbsp;1177 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
ancient princely families of Yemen, to recall the
legendary past and become the laureate of a
long vanished and well-nigh forgotten empire.
In 'The &#7716;imyarite Ode' (<i>al-Qa&#7779;&iacute;datu &#8217;l-&#7716;imyariyya</i>) he sings
the might and grandeur of the monarchs who ruled over his
people, and moralises in true Mu&#7717;ammadan spirit upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#"><span><i>LITERARY MATERIALS</i></span>13</a></span>
fleetingness of life and the futility of human ambition.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
Accompanying the Ode, which has little value except as a
comparatively unfalsified record of royal names,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> is a copious
historical commentary either by Nashw&aacute;n himself, as Von
Kremer thinks highly probable, or by some one who lived
about the same time. Those for whom history represents an
aggregate of naked facts would find nothing to the purpose in
this commentary, where threads of truth are almost inextricably
interwoven with fantastic and fabulous embroideries. A
literary form was first given to such legends by the professional
story-tellers of early Islam. One of these, the South Arabian
&#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. Sharya, visited Damascus by command of the Caliph
Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya I, who questioned him "concerning <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. Sharya.</span>
the ancient traditions, the kings of the Arabs and
other races, the cause of the confusion of tongues, and the
history of the dispersion of mankind in the various countries of
the world,"<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and gave orders that his answers should be put
together in writing and published under his name. This work,
of which unfortunately no copy has come down to us, was
entitled 'The Book of the Kings and the History of the
Ancients' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Mul&uacute;k wa-akhb&aacute;ru &#8217;l-M&aacute;&#7693;&iacute;n</i>). Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;956 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) speaks of it as a well-known book, enjoying a wide
circulation.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> It was used by the commentator of the &#7716;imyarite
Ode, either at first hand or through the medium of Hamd&aacute;n&iacute;'s
<i>Ikl&iacute;l</i>. We may regard it, like the commentary itself, as a
historical romance in which most of the characters and some of
the events are real, adorned with fairy-tales, fictitious verses,
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>14</a></span>
and such entertaining matter as a man of learning and story-teller
by trade might naturally be expected to introduce.
Among the few remaining Mu&#7717;ammadan authors who <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;amza of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n.</span>
bestowed special attention on the Pre-islamic period of
South Arabian history, I shall mention here only
&#7716;amza of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, the eighth book of whose
Annals (finished in 961 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) provides a useful
sketch, with brief chronological details, of the Tubba&#8216;s or
&#7716;imyarite kings of Yemen.</p>

<p>Qa&#7717;&#7789;&aacute;n, the ancestor of the Southern Arabs, was succeeded
by his son Ya&#8216;rub, who is said to have been the first to use the
Arabic language, and the first to receive the salutations
with which the Arabs were accustomed <span class="sidenote">Ya&#8216;rub.</span>
to address their kings, viz., "<i>In&#8216;im &#7779;ab&aacute;&#7717;<sup>an</sup></i>" ("Good morning!")
and "<i>Abayta &#8217;l-la&#8216;na</i>" ("Mayst thou avoid malediction!").
His grandson, &#8216;Abd Shams Saba, is named as the
founder of Ma&#8217;rib and the builder of the famous Dyke, which,
according to others, was constructed by Luqm&aacute;n b. &#8216;&Aacute;d.
Saba had two sons, &#7716;imyar and Kahl&aacute;n. Before his
death he deputed the sovereign authority to &#7716;imyar,
and the task of protecting the frontiers and making
war upon the enemy to Kahl&aacute;n. Thus &#7716;imyar <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;imyar and Kahl&aacute;n.</span>
obtained the lordship, assumed the title Ab&uacute;
Ayman, and abode in the capital city of the
realm, while Kahl&aacute;n took over the defence of the borders
and the conduct of war.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Omitting the long series of mythical
Sab&aelig;an kings, of whom the legend has little or nothing to
relate, we now come to an event which fixed itself ineffaceably
in the memory of the Arabs, and which is known in their
traditions as <i>Saylu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arim</i>, or the Flood of the Dyke.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#"><span><i>THE DYKE OF MA&#8217;RIB</i></span>15</a></span>
Some few miles south-west of Ma&#8217;rib the mountains draw
together leaving a gap, through which flows the River Adana.
During the summer its bed is often dry, but in the
rainy season the water rushes down with such <span class="sidenote">The Dam of
Ma&#8217;rib.</span>
violence that it becomes impassable. In order to
protect the city from floods, and partly also for purposes of
irrigation, the inhabitants built a dam of solid masonry, which,
long after it had fallen into ruin, struck the imagination of
Mu&#7717;ammad, and was reckoned by Moslems among the wonders
of the world.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> That their historians have clothed the bare fact
of its destruction in ample robes of legendary circumstance is
not surprising, but renders abridgment necessary.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the third century of our era, or possibly
at an earlier epoch,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> the throne of Ma&#8217;rib was temporarily
occupied by &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;&Aacute;mir M&aacute;&#8217; al-Sam&aacute;, surnamed <span class="sidenote"> Its destruction
announced by
portents.</span>
Muzayqiy&aacute;.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> His wife, &#7826;ar&iacute;fa, was skilled
in the art of divination. She dreamed dreams and
saw visions which announced the impending calamity. "Go
to the Dyke," she said to her husband, who doubted her clairvoyance,
"and if thou see a rat digging holes in the Dyke
with its paws and moving huge boulders with its hind-legs, be
assured that the woe hath come upon us." So &#8216;Amr went to

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>16</a></span>

the Dyke and looked carefully, and lo, there was a rat moving
an enormous rock which fifty men could not have rolled from
its place. Convinced by this and other prodigies that the
Dyke would soon burst and the land be laid waste, he resolved
to sell his possessions and depart with his family; and, lest
conduct so extraordinary should arouse suspicion, he had recourse
to the following stratagem. He invited the chief men
of the city to a splendid feast, which, in accordance with a
preconcerted plan, was interrupted by a violent altercation
between himself and his son (or, as others relate, an orphan
who had been brought up in his house). Blows were exchanged,
and &#8216;Amr cried out, "O shame! on the day of my
glory a stripling has insulted me and struck my face." He
swore that he would put his son to death, but the guests
entreated him to show mercy, until at last he gave way.
"But by God," he exclaimed, "I will no longer remain in
a city where I have suffered this indignity. I will sell my
lands and my stock." Having successfully got rid of his
encumbrances&mdash;for there was no lack of buyers eager to take
him at his word&mdash;&#8216;Amr informed the people of the danger with
which they were threatened, and set out from Ma&#8217;rib at the
head of a great multitude. Gradually the waters made a
breach in the Dyke and swept over the country, spreading
devastation far and wide. Hence the proverb <i>Dhahab&uacute;</i> (or
<i>tafarraq&uacute;</i>) <i>ayd&iacute; Saba</i>, "They departed" (or "dispersed") "like
the people of Saba."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>This deluge marks an epoch in the history of South Arabia.
The waters subside, the land returns to cultivation <span class="sidenote"> Fall of the
Sab&aelig;an
Empire.</span>
and prosperity, but Ma&#8217;rib lies desolate, and the
Sab&aelig;ans have disappeared for ever, except "to
point a moral or adorn a tale." Al-A&#8216;sh&aacute; sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>The poet's reference to &#7716;imyar is not historically accurate.
It was only after the destruction of the Dyke and the dispersion
of the Sab&aelig;ans who built it<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> that the &#7716;imyarites, with their
capital &#7826;af&aacute;r (at a later period, &#7778;an&#8216;&aacute;) became the rulers of Yemen.</p>

<p>The first Tubba&#8216;, by which name the &#7716;imyarite kings are
known to Mu&#7717;ammadan writers, was &#7716;&aacute;rith, called al-R&aacute;&#8217;ish, <span class="sidenote">The Tubba&#8216;s.</span>

<p>Similarly, among the Tubba&#8216;s we find the Queen of Sheba,
whose adventures with <span class="sidenote"> Bilq&iacute;s.</span>Solomon are related in the twenty-seventh
chapter of the Koran. Although Mu&#7717;ammad
himself did not mention her name or
lineage, his interpreters were equal to the occasion and revealed
her as Bilq&iacute;s, the daughter of Shar&aacute;&#7717;&iacute;l (Shara&#7717;b&iacute;l).</p>

<p>Legend makes As&#8216;ad the hero of a brilliant expedition to
Persia, where he defeated the general sent against him by the
Arsacids, and penetrated to the Caspian Sea. On his way
home he marched through the &#7716;ij&aacute;z, and having learned that
his son, whom he left behind in Med&iacute;na, had been treacherously
murdered, he resolved to take a terrible vengeance on the
people of that city.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now while the Tubba&#8216; was carrying on war against them, there
came to him two Jewish Rabbins of the Ban&uacute; Quray&#7827;a, men deep in
knowledge, who when they heard that he wished to destroy the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>22</a></span>

city and its people, said to him: 'O King, forbear! Verily, if thou
wilt accept nothing save that which thou desirest, an intervention
will be made betwixt thee and the city, and we are <span class="sidenote">As&#8216;ad K&aacute;mil
and the
two Rabbins
of Med&iacute;na.</span>
not sure but that sudden chastisement may befall
thee.' 'Why so?' he asked. They answered: ''Tis
the place of refuge of a prophet who in the after
time shall go forth from the sacred territory of Quraysh: it shall be
his abode and his home.' So the king refrained himself, for he saw
that those two had a particular knowledge, and he was pleased with
what they told him. On departing from Med&iacute;na he followed them
in their religion.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> ... And he turned his face towards Mecca, that
being his way to Yemen, and when he was between <span class="sidenote">As&#8216;ad K&aacute;mil
at Mecca.</span>
&#8216;Usf&aacute;n and Amaj some Hudhalites came to him and
said: 'O King, shall we not guide thee to a house of
ancient treasure which the kings before thee neglected, wherein
are pearls and emeralds and chrysolites and gold and silver?' He
said, 'Yea.' They said: 'It is a temple at Mecca which those who
belong to it worship and in which they pray.' Now the Hudhalites
wished to destroy him thereby, knowing that destruction awaited
the king who should seek to violate its precinct. So on comprehending
what they proposed, he sent to the two Rabbins to ask
them about the affair. They replied: 'These folk intend naught
but to destroy thee and thine army; we wot not of any house in the
world that God hath chosen for Himself, save this. If thou do that
to which they invite thee, thou and those with thee will surely
perish together.' He said: 'What then is it ye bid me do when I
come there?' They said: 'Thou wilt do as its people do&mdash;make
the circuit thereof, and magnify and honour it, and shave thy head,
and humble thyself before it, until thou go forth from its precinct.'
He said: 'And what hinders you from doing that yourselves?'
'By God,' said they, 'it is the temple of our father Abraham, and
verily it is even as we told thee, but we are debarred therefrom by
the idols which its people have set up around it and by the blood-offerings
which they make beside it; for they are vile polytheists,'
or words to the same effect. The king perceived that their advice
was good and their tale true. He ordered the Hudhalites to
approach, and cut off their hands and feet. Then he continued his
march to Mecca, where he made the circuit of the temple, sacrificed
camels, and shaved his head. According to what is told, he stayed
six days at Mecca, feasting the inhabitants with the flesh of camels

and letting them drink honey.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>... Then he moved out with his
troops in the direction of Yemen, the two Rabbins accompanying
him; and on entering Yemen he called on his subjects <span class="sidenote"> He seeks to
establish

to adopt the religion which he himself had embraced,
but they refused unless the question were submitted
to the ordeal of fire which at that time existed in
Yemen; for as the Yemenites say, there was in their country a
fire that gave judgment between them in their disputes: it devoured
the wrong-doer but left the injured person unscathed.
The Yemenites therefore came forward with their <span class="sidenote"> The ordeal of
fire.</span>
idols and whatever else they used as a means of
drawing nigh unto God, and the two Rabbins came forward with
their scriptures hung on their necks like necklaces, and both parties
seated themselves at the place from which the fire was wont to
issue. And the fire blazed up, and the Yemenites shrank back from
it as it approached them, and were afraid, but the bystanders urged
them on and bade them take courage. So they held out until the
fire enveloped them and consumed the idols and images and the
men of &#7716;imyar, the bearers thereof; but the Rabbins came forth
safe and sound, their brows moist with sweat, and the scriptures
were still hanging on their necks. Thereupon the &#7716;imyarites consented
to adopt the king's religion, and this was the cause of
Judaism being established in Yemen."<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p></div>

<p>In connection with Ghaym&aacute;n a few words may be added

defiance upon the passing traveller. Two thousand
years ago, and probably long before, they
were occupied by powerful barons, more or less independent,
who in later times, when the &#7716;imyarite Empire had begun to
decline, always elected, and occasionally deposed, their royal
master. Of these castles the geographer Hamd&aacute;n&iacute; has given a
detailed account in the eighth book of his great work on the
history and antiquities of Yemen entitled the <i>Ikl&iacute;l</i>, or
'Crown.'<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The oldest and most celebrated was Ghumd&aacute;n,
the citadel of &#7778;an&#8216;&aacute;. It is described as a huge edifice of
twenty stories, each story ten cubits high. The <span class="sidenote"> Ghumd&aacute;n.</span>
four fa&ccedil;ades were built with stone of different
colours, white, black, green, and red. On the top story was
a chamber which had windows of marble framed with ebony
and planewood. Its roof was a slab of pellucid marble, so
that when the lord of Ghumd&aacute;n lay on his couch he saw the
birds fly overhead, and could distinguish a raven from a kite.
At each corner stood a brazen lion, and when the wind blew

it entered the hollow interior of the effigies and made a sound
like the roaring of lions.</p>

<p>The adventure of As&#8216;ad K&aacute;mil with the three witches must
have recalled to every reader certain scenes in <i>Macbeth</i>.
Curiously enough, in the history of his son &#7716;ass&aacute;n an incident
is related which offers a striking parallel to the march of
Birnam Wood. &#7788;asm and Jad&iacute;s have already been mentioned.
On the massacre of the former tribe by the latter, a
single &#7788;asmite named Rib&aacute;&#7717; b. Murra made his escape and
took refuge with the Tubba&#8216; &#7716;ass&aacute;n, whom he persuaded to
lead an expedition against the murderers. Now Rib&aacute;&#7717;'s sister
had married a man of Jad&iacute;s. Her name was <span class="sidenote">Zarq&aacute;&#8217;u
&#8217;l-Yam&aacute;ma.</span>
Zarq&aacute;&#8217;u &#8217;l-Yam&aacute;ma&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Blue-eyed Woman
of Yam&aacute;ma&mdash;and she had such piercing sight that
she was able to descry an army thirty miles away. &#7716;ass&aacute;n
therefore bade his horsemen hold in front of them leafy
branches which they tore down from the trees. They
advanced thus hidden, and towards evening, when they had
come within a day's journey, Zarq&aacute; said to her people: "I
see trees marching." No one believed her until it was too
late. Next morning &#7716;ass&aacute;n fell upon them and put the whole
tribe to the sword.</p>

<p>The warlike expeditions to which &#7716;ass&aacute;n devoted all his
energy were felt as an intolerable burden by the chiefs of
&#7716;imyar, who formed a plot to slay him and set <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;ass&aacute;n
murdered by
his brother.</span>
his brother &#8216;Amr on the throne. &#8216;Amr was at
first unwilling to lend himself to their designs,
but ultimately his scruples were overcome, and he
stabbed the Tubba&#8216; with his own hand. The assassin
suffered a terrible punishment. Sleep deserted him, and in his
remorse he began to execute the conspirators one after another.
There was, however, a single chief called Dh&uacute; <span class="sidenote">Dh&uacute; Ru&#8216;ayn.</span>
Ru&#8216;ayn, who had remained loyal and had done his
best to save &#8216;Amr from the guilt of fratricide. Finding his
efforts fruitless, he requested &#8216;Amr to take charge of a sealed

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>26</a></span>

paper which he brought with him, and to keep it in a safe
place until he should ask for it. &#8216;Amr consented and thought
no more of the matter. Afterwards, imagining that Dh&uacute;
Ru&#8216;ayn had joined in the fatal plot, he gave orders for his
execution. "How!" exclaimed Dh&uacute; Ru&#8216;ayn, "did not I tell
thee what the crime involved?" and he asked for the sealed
writing, which was found to contain these verses&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"O fool to barter sleep for waking! Blest</span>
<span class="i0">Is he alone whose eyelids close in rest.</span>
<span class="i0">Hath &#7716;imyar practised treason, yet 'tis plain</span>
<span class="i0">That God forgiveness owes to Dh&uacute; Ru&#8216;ayn.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>On reading this, &#8216;Amr recognised that Dh&uacute; Ru&#8216;ayn had
spoken the truth, and he spared his life.</p>

<p>With &#8216;Amr the Tubba&#8216; dynasty comes to an end. The
succeeding kings were elected by eight of the most powerful
barons, who in reality were independent princes, each ruling in
his strong castle over as many vassals and retainers as he could
bring into subjection. During this period the Abyssinians
conquered at least some part of the country, and Christian
viceroys were sent by the Naj&aacute;sh&iacute; (Negus) to govern it in his
name. At last Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, a descendant of the Tubba&#8216;
As&#8216;ad K&aacute;mil, crushed the rebellious barons and made himself
unquestioned monarch of Yemen. A fanatical adherent of
Judaism, he resolved to stamp out Christianity in <span class="sidenote"> Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s.</span>
Najr&aacute;n, where it is said to have been introduced
from Syria by a holy man called Faymiy&uacute;n (Phemion). The
&#7716;imyarites flocked to his standard, not so much from religious
motives as from hatred of the Abyssinians. The pretended
murder of two Jewish children gave Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s a plausible
<i>casus belli</i>. He marched against Najr&aacute;n with an overwhelming
force, entered the city, and bade the inhabitants <span class="sidenote">Massacre of the
Christians in
Najr&aacute;n (523 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
choose between Judaism and death. Many
perished by the sword; the rest were thrown into
a trench which the king ordered to be dug and filled with

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#"><span><i>DH&Uacute; NUW&Aacute;S</i></span>27</a></span>

blazing fire. Nearly a hundred years later, when Mu&#7717;ammad
was being sorely persecuted, he consoled and encouraged his
followers by the example of the Christians of Najr&aacute;n, who
suffered "<i>for no other reason but that they believed in the mighty,
the glorious God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s paid dearly for his triumph.
Daws Dh&uacute; Tha&#8216;lab&aacute;n, one of those who escaped from the
massacre, fled to the Byzantine emperor and implored him, as
the head of Christendom, to assist them in obtaining vengeance.
Justinus accordingly wrote a letter to the Naj&aacute;sh&iacute;, desiring him
to take action, and ere long an Abyssinian army, 70,000
strong, under the command of Ary&aacute;&#7789;, disembarked in Yemen.
Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s could not count on the loyalty of the &#7716;imyarite
nobles; his troops melted away. "When he saw <span class="sidenote"> Death of
Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s.</span>
the fate that had befallen himself and his people,
he turned to the sea and setting spurs to his horse,
rode through the shallows until he reached the deep water.
Then he plunged into the waves and nothing more of him
was seen."<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Thus died, or thus at any rate should have died, the last
representative of the long line of &#7716;imyarite kings. Henceforth
Yemen appears in Pre-islamic history only as an Abyssinian
dependency or as a Persian protectorate. The events
now to be related form the prologue to a new drama in which
South Arabia, so far from being the centre of interest, plays an
almost insignificant r&ocirc;le.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the death of Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, the Abyssinian general Ary&aacute;&#7789;
continued his march through Yemen. He slaughtered a third part
of the males, laid waste a third part of the land, and
sent a third part of the women and children to the <span class="sidenote"> Yemen under
Abyssinian rule.</span>
Naj&aacute;sh&iacute; as slaves. Having reduced the Yemenites to
submission and re-established order, he held the position of viceroy

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#"><span><i>SABA AND &#7716;IMYAR</i></span>28</a></span>

for several years. Then mutiny broke out in the Abyssinian army
of occupation, and his authority was disputed by an officer, named
Abraha. When the rivals faced each other, Abraha said to Ary&aacute;&#7789;:
"What will it avail you to engage the Abyssinians in a civil war that
will leave none of them alive? Fight it out with me, and let the
troops follow the victor." His challenge being accepted, Abraha
stepped forth. He was a short, fleshy man, compactly built, a
devout Christian, while Ary&aacute;&#7789; was big, tall, and handsome.
When the duel began, Ary&aacute;&#7789; thrust his spear <span class="sidenote"> Abraha and
Ary&aacute;&#7789;.</span>
with the intention of piercing Abraha's brain, but it
glanced off his forehead, slitting his eyelid, nose, and lip&mdash;hence the
name, <i>al-Ashram</i>, by which Abraha was afterwards known; and ere
he could repeat the blow, a youth in Abraha's service, called
&#8216;Atwada, who was seated on a hillock behind his master, sprang
forward and dealt him a mortal wound. Thus Abraha found
himself commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian army, but the Naj&aacute;sh&iacute;
was enraged and swore not to rest until he set foot on the soil of
Yemen and cut off the rebel's forelock. On hearing this, Abraha
wrote to the Naj&aacute;sh&iacute;: "O King, Ary&aacute;&#7789; was thy servant even as I am.
We quarrelled over thy command, both of us owing allegiance to
thee, but I had more strength than he to command the Abyssinians
and keep discipline and exert authority. When I heard of the
king's oath, I shore my head, and now I send him a sack of the
earth of Yemen that he may put it under his feet and fulfil his oath."
The Naj&aacute;sh&iacute; answered this act of submission by appointing Abraha
to be his viceroy.... Then Abraha built the church
(<i>al-Qal&iacute;s</i>) at San&#8216;&aacute;, the like of which was not to be seen
at that time in the whole world, and wrote to the
Naj&aacute;sh&iacute; that he would not be content until he had diverted thither
every pilgrim in Arabia. This letter made much talk, and a man of
the Ban&uacute; Fuqaym, one of those who arranged the calendar, was
angered by what he learned of Abraha's purpose; so he went into
the church and defiled it. When Abraha heard that the author of
the outrage belonged to the people of the Temple in Mecca, and
that he meant to show thereby his scorn and contempt for the new
foundation, he waxed wroth and swore that he would march against
the Temple and lay it in ruins.</p></div>

<p>The disastrous failure of this expedition, which took place
in the year of the Elephant (570 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), did not at once free
Yemen from the Abyssinian yoke. The sons of Abraha,
Yaksum and Masr&uacute;q, bore heavily on the Arabs. Seeing no

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#"><span><i>THE ABYSSINIANS IN YEMEN</i></span>29</a></span>

help among his own people, a noble &#7716;imyarite named Sayf b.
Dh&iacute; Yazan resolved to seek foreign intervention. His choice
lay between the Byzantine and Persian empires, <span class="sidenote"> Sayf b. Dh&iacute;
Yazan.</span>
and he first betook himself to Constantinople.
Disappointed there, he induced the Arab king of
&#7716;&iacute;ra, who was under Persian suzerainty, to present him at the
court of Mad&aacute;&#8217;in (Ctesiphon). How he won audience of the
S&aacute;s&aacute;nian monarch, N&uacute;sh&iacute;rw&aacute;n, surnamed the Just, and tempted
him by an ingenious trick to raise a force of eight hundred
condemned felons, who were set free and shipped to Yemen
under the command of an aged general; how they literally
'burned their boats' and, drawing courage from despair, routed
the Abyssinian host and made Yemen a satrapy <span class="sidenote">The Persians in

which I have omitted here (apart from considerations
of space) because it belongs to Persian rather than to
Arabian literary history, being probably based, as N&ouml;ldeke has
suggested, on traditions handed down by the Persian conquerors
who settled in Yemen to their aristocratic descendants
whom the Arabs called <i>al-Abn&aacute;</i> (the Sons) or <i>Banu &#8217;l-A&#7717;r&aacute;r</i>
(Sons of the Noble).</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>

<h5>THE HISTORY AND LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</h5>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammadans include the whole period of Arabian history
from the earliest times down to the establishment of Islam
in the term <i>al-J&aacute;hiliyya</i>, which was used by <span class="sidenote"> The Age of
Barbarism
(al-J&aacute;hiliyya).</span>
Mu&#7717;ammad in four passages of the Koran and is
generally translated 'the state or ignorance' or
simply 'the Ignorance.' Goldziher, however, has shown conclusively
that the meaning attached to <i>jahl</i> (whence <i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i>
is derived) by the Pre-islamic poets is not so much 'ignorance'
as 'wildness,' 'savagery,' and that its true antithesis is not
<i>&#8216;ilm</i> (knowledge), but rather <i>&#7717;ilm</i>, which denotes the moral
reasonableness of a civilised man. "When Mu&#7717;ammadans say
that Islam put an end to the manners and customs of the
<i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i>, they have in view those barbarous practices, that
savage temper, by which Arabian heathendom is distinguished
from Islam and by the abolition of which Mu&#7717;ammad sought
to work a moral reformation in his countrymen: the haughty
spirit of the <i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i> (<i>&#7717;amiyyatu &#8217;l-J&aacute;hiliyya</i>), the tribal pride
and the endless tribal feuds, the cult of revenge, the implacability
and all the other pagan characteristics which Islam was
destined to overcome."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

the sole contemporary record of Pre-islamic

"Poetry is the public register of the Arabs (<i>al-shi&#8216;ru

chief collections of old Arabian poetry will be given in the
next chapter.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Proverbs.</i> These are of less value, as they seldom
explain themselves, while the commentary attached to them is
the work of scholars bent on explaining them at all costs,
though in many cases their true meaning could only be conjectured
and the circumstances of their origin had been entirely
forgotten. Notwithstanding this very pardonable excess of
zeal, we could ill afford to lose the celebrated collections
of Mufa&#7693;&#7693;al b. Salama (&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 900 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and Mayd&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1124

light on every aspect of Pre-islamic life.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Traditions and legends.</i> Since the art of writing was
neither understood nor practised by the heathen Arabs in
general, it was impossible that Prose, as a literary form, should
exist among them. The germs of Arabic Prose, however, may
be traced back to the <i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i>. Besides the proverb (<i>mathal</i>) and
the oration (<i>khu&#7789;ba</i>) we find elements of history and romance
in the prose narratives used by the rhapsodists to introduce and
set forth plainly the matter of their songs, and in the legends
which recounted the glorious deeds of tribes and individuals.
A vast number of such stories&mdash;some unmistakably genuine,
others bearing the stamp of fiction&mdash;are preserved in various
literary, historical, and geographical works composed under the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphate, especially in the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i> (Book

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>32</a></span>

of Songs) by Abu &#8217;l-Faraj of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;967 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), an invaluable
compilation based on the researches of the great Humanists
as they have been well named by Sir Charles Lyall, of the
second and third centuries after the Hijra.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> The original
writings of these early critics and scholars have <span class="sidenote"><i>The Book of
Songs.</i></span>
perished almost without exception, and beyond the
copious citations in the <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i> we possess hardly
any specimens of their work. "The <i>Book of Songs</i>," says Ibn
Khald&uacute;n, "is the Register of the Arabs. It comprises all that
they had achieved in the past of excellence in every kind of
poetry, history, music, <i>et cetera</i>. So far as I am aware, no other
book can be put on a level with it in this respect. It is the
final resource of the student of belles-lettres, and leaves him
nothing further to desire."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>In the following pages I shall not attempt to set in due
order and connection the confused mass of poetry and legend
in which all that we know of Pre-islamic Arabia <span class="sidenote"> Scope of
this chapter.</span>
lies deeply embedded. This task has already been
performed with admirable skill by Caussin de
Perceval in his <i>Essai sur l'histoire des Arabes avant l'Islamisme</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
and it could serve no useful purpose to inflict a dry summary
of that famous work upon the reader. The better course, I
think, will be to select a few typical and outstanding features
of the time and to present them, wherever possible, as they
have been drawn&mdash;largely from imagination&mdash;by the Arabs
themselves. If the Arabian traditions are wanting in historical
accuracy they are nevertheless, taken as a whole, true in spirit
to the Dark Age which they call up from the dead and
reverently unfold beneath our eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#"><span><i>ARAB KINGDOMS</i></span>33</a></span>
About the middle of the third century of our era Arabia
was enclosed on the north and north-east by the rival empires
of Rome and Persia, to which the Syrian desert, stretching
right across the peninsula, formed a natural termination. In
order to protect themselves from Bedouin raiders, who poured
over the frontier-provinces, and after laying hands on all the
booty within reach vanished as suddenly as they came, both
Powers found it necessary to plant a line of garrisons along
the edge of the wilderness. Thus the tribesmen were partially
held in check, but as force alone seemed an expensive and
inefficient remedy it was decided, in accordance with the well-proved
maxim, <i>divide et impera</i>, to enlist a number of the
offending tribes in the Imperial service. Regular pay and the
prospect of unlimited plunder&mdash;for in those days Rome and
Persia were almost perpetually at war&mdash;were inducements that
no true Bedouin could resist. They fought, however,
as free allies under their own chiefs or <span class="sidenote"> The Arab
dynasties of &#7716;&iacute;ra
and Ghass&aacute;n.</span>
phylarchs. In this way two Arabian dynasties
sprang up&mdash;the Ghass&aacute;nids in Syria and the Lakhmites at
&#7716;&iacute;ra, west of the Euphrates&mdash;military buffer-states, always
ready to collide even when they were not urged on by the
suzerain powers behind them. The Arabs soon showed what
they were capable of when trained and disciplined in arms.
On the defeat of Valerian by the Chosroes S&aacute;b&uacute;r I, an Arab
chieftain in Palmyra, named Udhayna (Odenathus), marched
at the head of a strong force against the conqueror, drove him
out of Syria, and pursued him up to the very walls of Mad&aacute;&#8217;in,
the Persian capital (265 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). His brilliant exploits were
duly rewarded by the Emperor Gallienus, who bestowed on
him the title of Augustus. He was, in fact, the <span class="sidenote"> Odenathus and
Zenobia.</span>
acknowledged master of the Roman legions in the
East when, a year later, he was treacherously
murdered. He found a worthy successor in his wife, the
noble and ambitious Zenobia, who set herself the task of
building up a great Oriental Empire. She fared, however, no

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>34</a></span>

better than did Cleopatra in a like enterprise. For a moment
the issue was doubtful, but Aurelian triumphed and the proud
'Queen of the East' was led a captive before his chariot
through the streets of Rome (274 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>These events were not forgotten by the Arabs. It flattered
their national pride to recall that once, at any rate, Roman
armies had marched under the flag of an Arabian princess.
But the legend, as told in their traditions, has little in common
with reality. Not only are names and places freely altered&mdash;Zenobia
herself being confused with her Syrian general, Zabdai&mdash;but
the historical setting, though dimly visible in the background,
has been distorted almost beyond recognition: what
remains is one of those romantic adventures which delighted
the Arabs of the <i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i>, just as their modern descendants
are never tired of listening to the <i>Story of &#8216;Antar</i> or to the
<i>Thousand Nights and a Night</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">The first king of the Arab settlers in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q (Babylonia)<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
is said to have been M&aacute;lik the Azdite, <span class="sidenote"> M&aacute;lik the Azdite.</span> who was accidentally
shot with an arrow by his son, Sulayma. Before
he expired he uttered a verse which has become
proverbial:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>U&#8216;allimuhu &#8217;l-rim&aacute;yata kulla yawm<sup>in</sup></i></span>

<span class="i05">"I taught him every day the bowman's art,</span>
<span class="i0">And when his arm took aim, he pierced my heart."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>M&aacute;lik's kingdom, if it can properly be described as such, was
consolidated and organised by his son, Jadh&iacute;ma, surnamed
al-Abrash (the Speckled)&mdash;a polite euphemism for <span class="sidenote"> Jadh&iacute;ma
al-Abrash.</span>
al-Abra&#7779; (the Leprous). He reigned as the vassal
of Ardash&iacute;r B&aacute;bak&aacute;n, the founder (226 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) of
the S&aacute;s&aacute;nian dynasty in Persia, which thereafter continued to
dominate the Arabs of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q during the whole Pre-islamic

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#"><span><i>JADH&Iacute;MA AL-ABRASH</i></span>35</a></span>

period. Jadh&iacute;ma is the hero of many fables and proverbs.
His pride, it is said, was so overweening that he would suffer
no boon-companions except two stars called <i>al-Farqad&aacute;n</i>, and
when he drank wine he used to pour out a cup for each of
them. He had a page, &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Na&#7779;r, with whom his sister fell
in love; and in a moment of intoxication he gave his consent
to their marriage. Next morning, furious at the trick which
had been played upon him, he beheaded the unlucky bridegroom
and reviled his sister for having married a slave.
Nevertheless, when a son was born, Jadh&iacute;ma adopted the boy,
and as he grew up regarded him with the utmost affection.
One day the youthful &#8216;Amr suddenly disappeared. For a long
time no trace of him could be found, but at last he was discovered,
running wild and naked, by two brothers, M&aacute;lik and
&#8216;Aq&iacute;l, who cared for him and clothed him and presented him
to the king. Overjoyed at the sight, Jadh&iacute;ma promised to
grant them whatever they asked. They chose the honour,
which no mortal had hitherto obtained, of being his boon-companions,
and by this title (<i>nadm&aacute;n&aacute; Jadh&iacute;ma</i>) they are
known to fame.</p>

<p>Jadh&iacute;ma was a wise and warlike prince. In one of his
expeditions he defeated and slew &#8216;Amr b. &#7826;arib b. &#7716;ass&aacute;n b.
Udhayna, an Arab chieftain who had brought part of Eastern
Syria and Mesopotamia under his sway, and who, as the name
Udhayna indicates, is probably identical with Odenathus, the
husband of Zenobia. This opinion is confirmed by the statement
of Ibn Qutayba that "Jadh&iacute;ma sought in marriage <span class="sidenote"> The story of
Zabb&aacute;.</span>

elected to succeed him when he fell in battle. However this
may be, she proved herself a woman of extraordinary courage
and resolution. As a safeguard against attack she built two
strong castles on either bank of the Euphrates and connected
them by a subterranean tunnel; she made one fortress her
own residence, while her sister, Zaynab, occupied the other.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Having thus secured her position she determined to take
vengeance on Jadh&iacute;ma. She wrote to him that the sceptre was
slipping from her feeble grasp, that she found no man worthy of
her except himself, that she desired to unite her kingdom with his
by marriage, and begged him to come and see her. Jadh&iacute;ma needed
no urging. Deaf to the warnings of his friend and counsellor,
Qa&#7779;&iacute;r, he started from Baqqa, a castle on the Euphrates. When
they had travelled some distance, Qa&#7779;&iacute;r implored him to return.
"No," said Jadh&iacute;ma, "the affair was decided at Baqqa"&mdash;words
which passed into a proverb. On approaching their destination the
king saw with alarm squadrons of cavalry between him and the city,
and said to Qa&#7779;&iacute;r, "What is the prudent course?" "You left
prudence at Baqqa," he replied; "if the cavalry advance and salute
you as king and then retire in front of you, the woman is sincere,
but if they cover your flanks and encompass you, they mean
treachery. Mount al-&#8216;A&#7779;&aacute;"&mdash;Jadh&iacute;ma's favourite mare&mdash;"for she
cannot be overtaken or outpaced, and rejoin your troops while
there is yet time." Jadh&iacute;ma refused to follow this advice. Presently
he was surrounded by the cavalry and captured. Qa&#7779;&iacute;r, however,
sprang on the mare's back and galloped thirty miles without drawing
rein.</p>

<p>When Jadh&iacute;ma was brought to Zabb&aacute; she seated him on a skin of
leather and ordered her maidens to open the veins in his arm, so
that his blood should flow into a golden bowl. "O Jadh&iacute;ma," said
she, "let not a single drop be lost. I want it as a cure for madness."
The dying man suddenly moved his arm and sprinkled with his
blood one of the marble pillars of the hall&mdash;an evil portent for
Zabb&aacute;, inasmuch as it had been prophesied by a certain soothsayer
that unless every drop of the king's blood entered the bowl, his
murder would be avenged.</p>

<p>Now Qa&#7779;&iacute;r came to &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Ad&iacute;, Jadh&iacute;ma's nephew and son by adoption,
who has been mentioned above, and engaged to win over the
army to his side if he would take vengeance on Zabb&aacute;. "But how?"
cried &#8216;Amr; " for she is more inaccessible than the eagle of the air."
"Only help me," said Qa&#7779;&iacute;r, "and you will be clear of blame." He

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#"><span><i>THE STORY OF ZABB&Aacute;</i></span>37</a></span>

cut off his nose and ears and betook himself to Zabb&aacute;, pretending
that he had been mutilated by &#8216;Amr. The queen believed what she
saw, welcomed him, and gave him money to trade on her behalf.
Qa&#7779;&iacute;r hastened to the palace of &#8216;Amr at &#7716;&iacute;ra, and, having obtained
permission to ransack the royal treasury, he returned laden with
riches. Thus he gradually crept into the confidence of Zabb&aacute;, until
one day he said to her: "It behoves every king and queen to provide
themselves with a secret passage wherein to take refuge in
case of danger." Zabb&aacute; answered: "I have already done so," and
showed him the tunnel which she had constructed underneath the
Euphrates. His project was now ripe for execution. With the
help of &#8216;Amr he fitted out a caravan of a thousand camels, each
carrying two armed men concealed in sacks. When they drew near
the city of Zabb&aacute;, Qa&#7779;&iacute;r left them and rode forward to announce
their arrival to the queen, who from the walls of her capital viewed
the long train of heavily burdened camels and marvelled at the slow
pace with which they advanced. As the last camel passed through
the gates of the city the janitor pricked one of the sacks with an
ox-goad which he had with him, and hearing a cry of pain, exclaimed,
"By God, there's mischief in the sacks!" But it was too late.
&#8216;Amr and his men threw themselves upon the garrison and put them
to the sword. Zabb&aacute; sought to escape by the tunnel, but Qa&#7779;&iacute;r stood
barring the exit on the further side of the stream. She hurried back,
and there was &#8216;Amr facing her. Resolved that her enemy should
not taste the sweetness of vengeance, she sucked her seal-ring,
which contained a deadly poison, crying, "By my own hand, not
by &#8216;Amr's!"<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p></div>

<p>In the kingdoms of &#7716;&iacute;ra and Ghass&aacute;n Pre-islamic culture
attained its highest development, and from these centres it
diffused itself and made its influence felt throughout Arabia.
Some account, therefore, of their history and of the circumstances
which enabled them to assume a civilising r&ocirc;le will
not be superfluous.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>38</a></span>

About the beginning of the third century after Christ a
number of Bedouin tribes, wholly or partly of Yemenite origin,
who had formed a confederacy and called themselves <span class="sidenote"> The foundation
of &#7716;&iacute;ra.</span>
collectively Tan&uacute;kh, took advantage of the
disorder then prevailing in the Arsacid Empire to
invade &#8216;Ir&aacute;q (Babylonia) and plant their settlements in the
fertile country west of the Euphrates. While part of the
intruders continued to lead a nomad life, others engaged in
agriculture, and in course of time villages and towns grew up.
The most important of these was &#7716;&iacute;ra (properly, al-&#7716;&iacute;ra,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Camp), which occupied a favourable and healthy
situation a few miles to the south of K&uacute;fa, in the neighbourhood
of ancient Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> According to Hish&aacute;m b.
Mu&#7717;ammad al-Kalb&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;819 or 821 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), an excellent
authority for the history of the Pre-islamic period, the
inhabitants of &#7716;&iacute;ra during the reign of Ardash&iacute;r B&aacute;bak&aacute;n,
the first S&aacute;s&aacute;nian king of Persia (226-241 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), consisted of
three classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The <i>Tan&uacute;kh</i>, who dwelt west of the Euphrates between
&#7716;&iacute;ra and Anb&aacute;r in tents of camel's hair.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>&#8216;Ib&aacute;d</i>, who lived in houses in &#7716;&iacute;ra.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>A&#7717;l&aacute;f</i> (Clients), who did not belong to either of
the above-mentioned classes, but attached themselves to the
people of &#7716;&iacute;ra and lived among them&mdash;blood-guilty fugitives

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#"><span><i>&#7716;&Iacute;RA AND ITS INHABITANTS</i></span>39</a></span>

pursued by the vengeance of their own kin, or needy emigrants
seeking to mend their fortunes.</p>

<p>Naturally the townsmen proper formed by far the most
influential element in the population. Hish&aacute;m, as we have
seen, calls them 'the &#8216;Ib&aacute;d.' His use of this <span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Ib&aacute;d.</span>
term, however, is not strictly accurate. The
&#8216;Ib&aacute;d are exclusively the <i>Christian Arabs of &#7716;&iacute;ra</i>, and are
so called in virtue of their Christianity; the pagan Arabs,
who at the time when &#7716;&iacute;ra was founded and for long
afterwards constituted the bulk of the citizens, were never
comprised in a designation which expresses the very opposite
of paganism. <i>&#8216;Ib&aacute;d</i> means 'servants,' <i>i.e.</i>, those who serve
God or Christ. It cannot be determined at what epoch the
name was first used to distinguish the religious community,
composed of members of different tribes, which was dominant
in &#7716;&iacute;ra during the sixth century. Dates are comparatively
of little importance; what is really remarkable is the
existence in Pre-islamic times of an Arabian community
that was not based on blood-relationship or descent from a
common ancestor, but on a spiritual principle, namely, the
profession of a common faith. The religion and culture of
the &#8216;Ib&aacute;d were conveyed by various channels to the inmost
recesses of the peninsula, as will be shown more fully in a
subsequent chapter. They were the schoolmasters of the
heathen Arabs, who could seldom read or write, and who, it
must be owned, so far from desiring to receive instruction,
rather gloried in their ignorance of accomplishments which
they regarded as servile. Nevertheless, the best minds among
the Bedouins were irresistibly attracted to &#7716;&iacute;ra. Poets in
those days found favour with princes. A great number of
Pre-islamic bards visited the Lakhmite court, while some,
like N&aacute;bigha and &#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. al-Abra&#7779;, made it their permanent
residence.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter into the vexed question as to the
origin and rise of the Lakhmite dynasty at &#7716;&iacute;ra. According

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>40</a></span>

to Hish&aacute;m b. Mu&#7717;ammad al-Kalbi, who gives a list of twenty
kings, covering a period of 522 years and eight months, the
first Lakhmite ruler was &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Na&#7779;r <span class="sidenote"> The Lakhmites.</span>
b. Rab&iacute;&#8216;a b. Lakhm, the same who was adopted
by Jadh&iacute;ma, and afterwards avenged his death on Queen
Zabb&aacute;. Almost nothing is known of his successors until we
come to Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n I, surnamed al-A&#8216;war (the One-eyed), <span class="sidenote">Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n I.
(<i>circa</i> 400 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
whose reign falls in the first quarter of the fifth
century. Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n is renowned in legend as the
builder of Khawarnaq, a famous castle near &#7716;&iacute;ra.
It was built at the instance of the S&aacute;s&aacute;nian king, Yazdigird I,
who desired a salubrious residence for his son, Prince Bahr&aacute;m
G&oacute;r. On its completion, Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n ordered the architect, a
'Roman' (<i>i.e.</i>, Byzantine subject) named Sinimm&aacute;r, to be
cast headlong from the battlements, either on account of his
boast that he could have constructed a yet more <span class="sidenote"> The Castle of
Khawarnaq.</span>
wonderful edifice "which should turn round
with the sun," or for fear that he might reveal
the position of a certain stone, the removal of which would
cause the whole building to collapse. One spring day (so the
story is told) Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n sat with his Vizier in Khawarnaq, which
overlooked the Fen-land (al-Najaf), with its neighbouring
gardens and plantations of palm-trees and canals, to the west,
and the Euphrates to the east. Charmed by the beauty of the
prospect, he exclaimed, "Hast thou ever seen the like of
this?" "No," replied the Vizier, "if it would <span class="sidenote">Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n
becomes an
anchorite.</span>
but last." "And what is lasting?" asked
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n. "That which is with God in heaven."
"How can one attain to it?" "By renouncing the world
and serving God, and striving after that which He hath."
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, it is said, immediately resolved to abandon his
kingdom; on the same night he clad himself in sackcloth,
stole away unperceived, and became a wandering devotee
(<i>s&aacute;&#8217;i&#7717;</i>). This legend seems to have grown out of the
following verses by &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Zayd, the &#8216;Ib&aacute;dite:&mdash;</p>

<p>The opinion of most Arabian authors, that Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n embraced
Christianity, is probably unfounded, but there is reason to
believe that he was well disposed towards it, and that his
Christian subjects&mdash;a Bishop of &#7716;&iacute;ra is mentioned as early as
410 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&mdash;enjoyed complete religious liberty.</p>

<p>Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n's place was filled by his son Mundhir, an able and
energetic prince. The power of the Lakhmites at this time
may be inferred from the fact that on the death <span class="sidenote"> Mundhir I.</span>
of Yazdigird I Mundhir forcibly intervened in
the dispute as to the Persian succession and procured the

shortly afterwards between Persia and Rome, Mundhir proved
himself a loyal vassal, but was defeated by the Romans with
great loss (421 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Passing over several obscure reigns, we
arrive at the beginning of the sixth century, when another
Mundhir, the third and most illustrious of his <span class="sidenote">Mundhir III,
b. M&aacute;&#8217; al-sam&aacute;.</span>
name, ascended the throne. This is he whom the
Arabs called Mundhir b. M&aacute;&#8217; al-sam&aacute;.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> He had
a long and brilliant reign, which, however, was temporarily

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>42</a></span>

clouded by an event that cannot be understood without some
reference to the general history of the period. About 480 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
the powerful tribe of Kinda, whose princes appear to have held
much the same position under the Tubba&#8216;s of Yemen as the
Lakhmites under the Persian monarchs, had extended their
sway over the greater part of Central and Northern Arabia.
The moving spirit in this conquest was &#7716;ujr, <span class="sidenote"> Rise of Kinda.</span>
surnamed Akilu &#8217;l-Mur&aacute;r, an ancestor of the
poet Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays. On his death the Kindite confederacy
was broken up, but towards the year 500 it was re-established
for a brief space by his grandson, &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#8216;Amr, and became
a formidable rival to the kingdoms of Ghass&aacute;n and &#7716;&iacute;ra.
Meanwhile, in Persia, the communistic doctrines of Mazdak
had obtained wide popularity among the lower <span class="sidenote"> Mazdak.</span>
classes, and were finally adopted by King Kaw&aacute;dh
himself.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Now, it is certain that at some date between 505
and 529 &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#8216;Amr, the Kindite, invaded &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, and drove
Mundhir out of his kingdom; and it seems not impossible
that, as many historians assert, the latter's downfall
was due to his anti-Mazdakite opinions, which <span class="sidenote"> Mundhir
expelled from
&#7716;&iacute;ra by &#7716;&aacute;rith
of Kinda.</span>
would naturally excite the displeasure of his
suzerain. At any rate, whatever the causes may
have been, Mundhir was temporarily supplanted by &#7716;&aacute;rith,
and although he was restored after a short interval, before the
accession of An&uacute;shirw&aacute;n, who, as Crown Prince, carried out
a wholesale massacre of the followers of Mazdak (528 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
the humiliation which he had suffered and cruelly avenged was
not soon forgotten;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> the life and poems of Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays

bear witness to the hereditary hatred subsisting between
Lakhm and Kinda. Mundhir's operations against the
Romans were conducted with extraordinary vigour; he
devastated Syria as far as Antioch, and Justinian saw himself
obliged to entrust the defence of these provinces to the
Ghass&aacute;nid &#7716;&aacute;rith b. Jabala (&#7716;&aacute;rith al-A&#8216;raj), in whom
Mundhir at last found more than his match. From this time
onward the kings of &#7716;&iacute;ra and Ghass&aacute;n are continually raiding
and plundering each other's territory. In one of his expeditions
Mundhir captured a son of &#7716;&aacute;rith, and "immediately
sacrificed him to Aphrodite"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to the Arabian goddess
al-&#8216;Uzz&aacute;;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>&mdash;but on taking the field again in 554 he was
surprised and slain by stratagem in a battle which <span class="sidenote"> Death of
Mundhir III.</span>
is known proverbially as 'The Day of &#7716;al&iacute;ma.'<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
On the whole, the Lakhmites were a heathen and
barbarous race, and these epithets are richly deserved by
Mundhir III. It is related in the <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i> that he had two
boon-companions, Kh&aacute;lid b. al-Mu&#7693;allil and &#8216;Amr b. Mas&#8216;&uacute;d,
with whom he used to carouse; and once, being irritated by
words spoken in wine, he gave orders that they should be
buried alive. Next morning he did not recollect what had
passed and inquired as usual for his friends. On learning
the truth he was filled with remorse. He caused two
obelisks to be erected over their graves, and two
days in every year he would come and sit beside <span class="sidenote"> Mundhir's
"Good Day and
Evil Day."</span>
these obelisks, which were called <i>al-Ghariyy&aacute;n</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the Blood-smeared. One day was the Day of Good
(<i>yawmu na&#8216;im<sup>in</sup></i>), and whoever first encountered him on that
day received a hundred black camels. The other day was the
Day of Evil (<i>yawmu bu&#8217;s<sup>in</sup></i>), on which he would present the
first-comer with the head of a black polecat (<i>&#7827;arib&aacute;n</i>), then
sacrifice him and smear the obelisks with his blood.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> The

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>44</a></span>

poet &#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. al-Abra&#7779; is said to have fallen a victim to this
horrible rite. It continued until the doom fell upon a certain
&#7716;an&#7827;ala of &#7788;ayyi&#8217;, who was granted a year's grace in order to
regulate his affairs, on condition that he should find a surety.
He appealed to one of Mundhir's suite, Shar&iacute;k b. &#8216;Amr, who
straightway rose and said to the king, "My hand <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;an&#7827;ala and
Shar&iacute;k.</span>
for his and my blood for his if he fail to return
at the time appointed." When the day came
&#7716;an&#7827;ala did not appear, and Mundhir was about to sacrifice
Shar&iacute;k, whose mourning-woman had already begun to chant
the dirge. Suddenly a rider was seen approaching, wrapped
in a shroud and perfumed for burial. A mourning-woman
accompanied him. It was &#7716;an&#7827;ala. Mundhir marvelled at
their loyalty, dismissed them with marks of honour, and
abolished the custom which he had instituted.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son &#8216;Amr, who is known to
contemporary poets and later historians as &#8216;Amr, son of Hind.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
During his reign &#7716;&iacute;ra became an important literary
centre. Most of the famous poets then living <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Amr B. Hind
(554-569 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
visited his court; we shall see in the next chapter
what relations he had with &#7788;arafa, &#8216;Amr b. Kulth&uacute;m,
and &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#7716;illiza. He was a morose, passionate, and
tyrannical man. The Arabs stood in great awe of him, but
vented their spite none the less. "At &#7716;&iacute;ra," said Dah&aacute;b
al-&#8216;Ijl&iacute;, "there are mosquitoes and fever and lions and &#8216;Amr b.
Hind, who acts unjustly and wrongfully."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> He was slain by

Mundhir IV, both of whom were sons of Hind, and occupied
the throne for short periods. We now come to the
last Lakhmite king of &#7716;&iacute;ra, and by far the <span class="sidenote">Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n Ab&uacute;
Q&aacute;b&uacute;s.</span>
most celebrated in tradition, Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n III, son of
Mundhir IV, with the <i>kunya</i> (name of honour) Ab&uacute;
Q&aacute;b&uacute;s, who reigned from 580 to 602 or from 585 to 607.
He was brought up and educated by a noble Christian family
in &#7716;&iacute;ra, the head of which was Zayd b. &#7716;amm&aacute;d, father of the
poet &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Zayd. &#8216;Ad&iacute; is such an interesting figure, and his
fortunes were so closely and tragically linked with those of
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, that some account of his life and character will be
acceptable. Both his father and grandfather were men of
unusual culture, who held high posts in the civil administration
under Mundhir III and his successors. Zayd, moreover,
through the good offices of a <i>dihq&aacute;n</i>, or Persian
landed proprietor, Farrukh-m&aacute;h&aacute;n by name, <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Zayd.</span>
obtained from Khusraw An&uacute;shirw&aacute;n an important and confidential
appointment&mdash;that of Postmaster&mdash;ordinarily reserved
for the sons of satraps.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> When &#8216;Ad&iacute; grew up, his father sent
him to be educated with the son of the <i>dihq&aacute;n</i>. He learned
to write and speak Persian with complete facility and Arabic
with the utmost elegance; he versified, and his accomplishments
included archery, horsemanship, and polo. At the
Persian court his personal beauty, wit, and readiness in reply
so impressed An&uacute;shirw&aacute;n that he took him into his service
as secretary and interpreter&mdash;Arabic had never before been
written in the Imperial Chancery&mdash;and accorded him all the
privileges of a favourite. He was entrusted with a mission to
Constantinople, where he was honourably received; and on his
departure the Qay&#7779;ar,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> following an excellent custom, instructed
the officials in charge of the post-routes to provide horses and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>46</a></span>

every convenience in order that the ambassador might see for
himself the extent and resources of the Byzantine Empire.
&#8216;Ad&iacute; passed some time in Syria, especially at Damascus, where
his first poem is said to have appeared. On his father's death,
which happened about this time, he renounced the splendid
position at &#7716;&iacute;ra which he might have had for the asking, and
gave himself up to hunting and to all kinds of amusement
and pleasure, only visiting Mad&aacute;&#8217;in (Ctesiphon) at intervals to
perform his secretarial duties. While staying at &#7716;&iacute;ra he fell
in love with Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n's daughter Hind, who was then eleven
years old. The story as told in the <i>Book of Songs</i> is too curious
to be entirely omitted, though want of space prevents me from
giving it in full.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is related that Hind, who was one of the fairest women of her
time, went to church on Thursday of Holy Week, three days after
Palm Sunday, to receive the sacrament. &#8216;Ad&iacute; had <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Ad&iacute; meets the
Princess Hind
in church.</span>
entered the church for the same purpose. He espied
her&mdash;she was a big, tall girl&mdash;while she was off her
guard, and fixed his gaze upon her before she became
aware of him. Her maidens, who had seen him approaching, said
nothing to their mistress, because one of them called M&aacute;riya was
enamoured of &#8216;Ad&iacute; and knew no other way of making his acquaintance.
When Hind saw him looking at herself, she was highly
displeased and scolded her handmaidens and beat some of them.
&#8216;Ad&iacute; had fallen in love with her, but he kept the matter secret for a
whole year. At the end of that time M&aacute;riya, thinking that Hind had
forgotten what passed, described the church of Th&oacute;m&aacute; (St. Thomas)
and the nuns there and the girls who frequented it, and the beauty
of the building and of the lamps, and said to her, "Ask thy mother's
leave to go." As soon as leave was granted, M&aacute;riya conveyed the
intelligence to &#8216;Ad&iacute;, who immediately dressed himself in a magnificent

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#"><span><i>AD&Iacute; THE SON OF ZAYD</i></span>47</a></span>

gold-embroidered Persian tunic (<i>yalmaq</i>) and hastened to the
rendezvous, accompanied by several young men of &#7716;&iacute;ra. When
M&aacute;riya perceived him, she cried to Hind, "Look at this youth: by
God, he is fairer than the lamps and all things else that thou seest."
"Who is he?" she asked. "&#8216;Ad&iacute;, son of Zayd." "Do you think,"
said Hind, "that he will recognise me if I come nearer?" Then
she advanced and watched him as he conversed with his friends,
outshining them all by the beauty of his person, the elegance of his
language, and the splendour of his dress. "Speak to him," said
M&aacute;riya to her young mistress, whose countenance betrayed her
feelings. After exchanging a few words the lovers parted. M&aacute;riya
went to &#8216;Ad&iacute; and promised, if he would first gratify her wishes, to
bring about his union with Hind. She lost no time in warning
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n that his daughter was desperately in love with &#8216;Ad&iacute; and
would either disgrace herself or die of grief unless he gave her to
him. Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, however, was too proud to make overtures to &#8216;Ad&iacute;,
who on his part feared to anger the prince by proposing an alliance.
The ingenious M&aacute;riya found a way out of the difficulty. She suggested
that &#8216;Ad&iacute; should invite Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n and his suite to a banquet, <span class="sidenote"> His marriage to
Hind.</span>
and having well plied him with wine should ask for the hand of his
daughter, which would not then be refused. So it
came to pass. Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n gave his consent to the marriage,
and after three days Hind was brought home
to her husband.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p></div>

<p>On the death of Mundhir IV &#8216;Ad&iacute; warmly supported the

The ruse which he employed on this occasion
was completely successful, but it cost him his
life.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The partisans of Aswad b. Mundhir, one of the defeated

was cast into prison, where he languished for a
long time and was finally murdered by Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n
when the Chosroes (Parw&eacute;z, son of Hurmuz) had
already intervened to procure his release.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>&#8216;Ad&iacute; left a son named Zayd, who, on the recommendation
of Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, was appointed by Khusraw Parw&eacute;z to succeed his <span class="sidenote">The vengeance
of Zayd b. &#8216;Ad&iacute;.</span>
father as Secretary for Arabian Affairs at the court
of Ctesiphon. Apparently reconciled to Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n,
he was none the less bent on vengeance, and only waited for
an opportunity. The kings of Persia were connoisseurs in
female beauty, and when they desired to replenish their harems
they used to circulate an advertisement describing with extreme
particularity the physical and moral qualities which were to be
sought after;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> but hitherto they had neglected Arabia, which,
as they supposed, could not furnish any woman possessed of
these perfections. Zayd therefore approached the Chosroes
and said: "I know that Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n has in his family a number
of women answering to the description. Let me go to him,
and send with me one of thy guardsmen who understands
Arabic." The Chosroes complied, and Zayd set out for &#7716;&iacute;ra.
On learning the object of his mission, Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n exclaimed with
indignation: "What! are not the gazelles of Persia sufficient
for your needs?" The comparison of a beautiful woman to a
gazelle is a commonplace in Arabian poetry, but the officer
accompanying Zayd was ill acquainted with Arabic, and asked
the meaning of the word (<i>&#8216;&iacute;n</i> or <i>mah&aacute;</i>) which Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n had
employed. "Cows," said Zayd. When Parw&eacute;z heard from <span class="sidenote">Death of
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n III.</span>
his guardsman that Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n had said, "Do not the
cows of Persia content him?" he could scarcely
suppress his rage. Soon afterwards he sent for Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#"><span><i>DEATH OF NU&#8216;M&Aacute;N III</i></span>49</a></span>

threw him into chains, and caused him to be trampled to
pieces by elephants.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n III appears in tradition as a tyrannical prince,
devoted to wine, women, and song. He was the patron of
many celebrated poets, and especially of N&aacute;bigha <span class="sidenote">Character of
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n III.</span>
Dhuby&aacute;n&iacute;, who was driven from &#7716;&iacute;ra in consequence
of a false accusation. This episode, as well as
another in which the poet Munakhkhal was concerned, gives
us a glimpse into the private life of Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n. He had married
his step-mother, Mutajarrida, a great beauty in her time; but
though he loved her passionately, she bestowed her affections
elsewhere. N&aacute;bigha was suspected on account of a poem in
which he described the charms of the queen with the utmost
minuteness, but Munakhkhal was the real culprit. The lovers
were surprised by Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, and from that day Munakhkhal
was never seen again. Hence the proverb, "Until Munakhkhal
shall return," or, as we might say, "Until the coming of
the Coqcigrues."</p>

<p>Although several of the kings of &#7716;&iacute;ra are said to have been
Christians, it is very doubtful whether any except Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n III
deserved even the name; the Lakhmites, unlike <span class="sidenote">Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n's
conversion to
Christianity.</span>
the majority of their subjects, were thoroughly
pagan. Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n's education would naturally predispose
him to Christianity, and his conversion may have been
wrought, as the legend asserts, by his mentor &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Zayd.</p>

<p>According to Mu&#7717;ammadan genealogists, the Ghass&aacute;nids,
both those settled in Med&iacute;na and those to whom the name
is consecrated by popular usage&mdash;the Ghass&aacute;nids <span class="sidenote"> The Ghass&aacute;nids
or Jafnites.</span>
of Syria&mdash;are descended from &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;&Aacute;mir
al-Muzayqiy&aacute;, who, as was related in the last chapter, sold his
possessions in Yemen and quitted the country, taking with him
a great number of its inhabitants, shortly before the Bursting of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>50</a></span>

the Dyke of Ma&#8217;rib. His son Jafna is generally regarded as
the founder of the dynasty. Of their early history very few
authentic facts have been preserved. At first, we are told,
they paid tribute to the &#7692;aj&aacute;&#8216;ima, a family of the stock of
Sal&iacute;&#7717;, who ruled the Syrian borderlands under Roman protection.
A struggle ensued, from which the Ghass&aacute;nids
emerged victorious, and henceforth we find them established
in these regions as the representatives of Roman authority
with the official titles of Patricius and Phylarch, which they
and the Arabs around them rendered after the simple Oriental
fashion by 'King' (<i>malik</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The first (says Ibn Qutayba) that reigned in Syria of the family
of Jafna was &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#8216;Amr Mu&#7717;arriq, who was so called because <span class="sidenote"> Ibn Qutayba's
account of the
Ghass&aacute;nids.</span>
he burnt (<i>&#7717;arraqa</i>) the Arabs in their houses. He is
&#7716;&aacute;rith the Elder (al-Akbar), and his name of honour
(<i>kunya</i>) is Ab&uacute; Shamir. After him reigned &#7716;&aacute;rith b.
Ab&iacute; Shamir, known as &#7716;&aacute;rith the Lame (<i>al-A&#8216;raj</i>),
whose mother was M&aacute;riya of the Ear-rings. He was the best of
their kings, and the most fortunate, and the craftiest; and in his
raids he went the farthest afield. He led an expedition against
Khaybar<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and carried off a number of prisoners, but set them free
after his return to Syria. When Mundhir b. M&aacute;&#8217; al-sam&aacute; marched
against him with an army 100,000 strong, &#7716;&aacute;rith sent <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;&aacute;rith the Lame.</span>
a hundred men to meet him&mdash;among them the poet
Lab&iacute;d, who was then a youth&mdash;ostensibly to make peace. They
surrounded Mundhir's tent and slew the king and his companions;
then they took horse, and some escaped, while others were slain.
The Ghass&aacute;nid cavalry attacked the army of Mundhir and put them
to flight. &#7716;&aacute;rith had a daughter named &#7716;al&iacute;ma, who perfumed the
hundred champions on that day and clad them in shrouds of white
linen and coats of mail. She is the heroine of the proverb, "The
day of &#7716;al&iacute;ma is no secret."<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> &#7716;&aacute;rith was succeeded by his son,
&#7716;&aacute;rith the Younger. Among his other sons were &#8216;Amr b. &#7716;&aacute;rith
(called Ab&uacute; Shamir the Younger), to whom N&aacute;bigha came on leaving
Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n b. Mundhir; Mundhir b. &#7716;&aacute;rith; and al-Ayham b. &#7716;&aacute;rith.
Jabala, the son of al-Ayham, was the last of the kings of Ghass&aacute;n.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#"><span><i>THE JAFNITE DYNASTY</i></span>51</a></span>

He was twelve spans in height, and his feet brushed the ground
when he rode on horseback. He reached the Islamic period and became
a Moslem in the Caliphate of &#8216;Umar b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b, <span class="sidenote"> Jabala b. al-Ayham.</span>
but afterwards he turned Christian and went to live in
the Byzantine Empire. The occasion of his turning
Christian was this: In passing through the bazaar of Damascus he
let his horse tread upon one of the bystanders, who sprang up and
struck Jabala a blow on the face. The Ghass&aacute;n&iacute;s seized the fellow
and brought him before Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda b. al-Jarr&aacute;&#7717;,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> complaining that
he had struck their master. Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda demanded proof. "What
use wilt thou make of the proof?" said Jabala. He answered: "If
he has struck thee, thou wilt strike him a blow in return." "And
shall not he be slain?" "No." "Shall not his hand be cut off?"
"No," said Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda; "God has ordained retaliation only&mdash;blow
for blow." Then Jabala went forth and betook himself to
Roman territory and became a Christian; and he stayed there all
the rest of his life.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p></div>

<p>The Arabian traditions respecting the dynasty of Ghass&aacute;n
are hopelessly confused and supply hardly any material even for <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;&aacute;rith the Lame.</span>
the rough historical sketch which may be pieced
together from the scattered notices in Byzantine
authors.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> It would seem that the first unquestionable Ghass&aacute;nid
prince was &#7716;&aacute;rith b. Jabala (&#7944;&#961;&#8051;&#952;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#915;&#945;&#946;&#8049;&#955;&#945;), who
figures in Arabian chronicles as '&#7716;&aacute;rith the Lame,' and who
was appointed by Justinian (about 529 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) to balance, on the
Roman side, the active and enterprising King of &#7716;&iacute;ra, Mundhir
b. M&aacute;&#8217; al-sam&aacute;. During the greater part of his long reign
(529-569 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) he was engaged in war with this dangerous
rival, to whose defeat and death in the decisive battle of
&#7716;al&iacute;ma we have already referred. Like all his line, &#7716;&aacute;rith
was a Christian of the Monophysite Church, which he defended
with equal zeal and success at a time when its very existence

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>52</a></span>

was at stake. The following story illustrates his formidable
character. Towards the end of his life he visited Constantinople
to arrange with the Imperial Government which of his
sons should succeed him, and made a powerful impression on
the people of that city, especially on the Emperor's nephew,
Justinus. Many years afterwards, when Justinus had fallen
into dotage, the chamberlains would frighten him, when he
began to rave, with "Hush! Arethas will come and take you."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;rith was succeeded by his son, Mundhir, who vanquished
the new King of &#7716;&iacute;ra, Q&aacute;b&uacute;s b. Hind, on Ascension Day,
<span class="sidenote"> Mundhir b.
&#7716;&aacute;rith.</span>570 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, in a battle which is perhaps identical
with that celebrated by the Arabs as the Battle of
&#8216;Ayn Ub&aacute;gh. The refusal of the Emperor Justinus to furnish
him with money may have prevented Mundhir from pursuing
his advantage, and was the beginning of open hostility between
them, which culminated about eleven years later in his being
carried off to Constantinople and forced to reside in Sicily.</p>

<p>From this time to the Persian conquest of Palestine
(614 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) anarchy prevailed throughout the Ghass&aacute;nid
kingdom. The various tribes elected their own princes, who
sometimes, no doubt, were Jafnites; but the dynasty had
virtually broken up. Possibly it was restored by Heraclius
when he drove the Persians out of Syria (629 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), as the
Ghass&aacute;nians are repeatedly found fighting for Rome against
the Moslems, and according to the unanimous testimony of
Arabian writers, the Jafnite Jabala b. al-Ayham, who took an
active part in the struggle, was the last king of Ghass&aacute;n.
His accession may be placed about 635 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> The poet
&#7716;ass&aacute;n b. Th&aacute;bit, who as a native of Med&iacute;na could claim
kinship with the Ghass&aacute;nids, and visited their court in his
youth, gives a glowing description of its luxury and magnificence.</p>

would drink wine he sat on a couch of myrtle and
jasmine and all sorts of sweet-smelling flowers, surrounded
by gold and silver vessels full of ambergris and musk.
During winter aloes-wood was burned in his apartments, while in
summer he cooled himself with snow. Both he and his courtiers
wore light robes, arranged with more regard to comfort than ceremony,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>

in the cold season; and, by God, I was never in his company but
he gave me the robe which he was wearing on that day, and many
of his friends were thus honoured. He treated the rude with forbearance;
he laughed without reserve and lavished his gifts before
they were sought. He was handsome, and agreeable in conversation:
I never knew him offend in speech or act."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p></div>

<p>Unlike the rival dynasty on the Euphrates, the Ghass&aacute;nids
had no fixed residence. They ruled the country round
Damascus and Palmyra, but these places were never in their
possession. The capital of their nomad kingdom was the
temporary camp (in Aramaic, <i>&#7717;&eacute;rt&aacute;</i>) which followed them to
and fro, but was generally to be found in the Gaulonitis

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>54</a></span>

(al-Jawl&aacute;n), south of Damascus. Thus under the quickening
impulse of Hellenistic culture the Ghass&aacute;nids developed a civilisation
far superior to that of the Lakhmites, who, <span class="sidenote"> Ghass&aacute;nid
civilisation.</span>
just because of their half-barbarian character,
were more closely in touch with the heathen
Arabs, and exercised a deeper influence upon them. Some
aspects of this civilisation have been indicated in the description
of Jabala b. al-Ayham's court, attributed to the poet
&#7716;ass&aacute;n. An earlier bard, the famous N&aacute;bigha, having fallen
out of favour with Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n III of H&iacute;ra, fled to Syria, where
he composed a splendid eulogy of the Ghass&aacute;nids <span class="sidenote"> N&aacute;bigha's
encomium.</span>
in honour of his patron, King &#8216;Amr, son of &#7716;&aacute;rith

<p>The Pre-islamic history of the Bedouins is mainly a record
of wars, or rather guerillas, in which a great deal of raiding
and plundering was accomplished, as a rule without serious
bloodshed. There was no lack of shouting; volleys of vaunts

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#"><span><i>HISTORY OF THE BEDOUINS</i></span>55</a></span>

and satires were exchanged; camels and women were carried
off; many skirmishes took place but few pitched battles: it
was an Homeric kind of warfare that called forth individual
exertion in the highest degree, and gave ample opportunity for
single-handed deeds of heroism. "To write a true history of
such Bedouin feuds is well-nigh impossible. As comparatively
trustworthy sources of information we have only the <span class="sidenote"> Character of
Bedouin
history.</span>
poems and fragments of verse which have been preserved.
According to Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute;, the Arabian traditionists
used to demand from any Bedouin who related
an historical event the citation of some verses in
its support; and, in effect, all such stories that have come
down to us are crystallised round the poems. Unfortunately
these crystals are seldom pure. It appears only too often that
the narratives have been invented, with abundant fancy and
with more or less skill, to suit the contents of the verses."<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
But although what is traditionally related concerning the
Battle-days of the Arabs (<i>Ayy&aacute;mu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab</i>) is to a large extent
legendary, it describes with sufficient fidelity how tribal hostilities
generally arose and the way in which they were conducted.
The following account of the War of Bas&uacute;s&mdash;the
most famous of those waged in Pre-islamic times&mdash;will serve
to illustrate this important phase of Bedouin life.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Towards the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Kulayb, son of Rab&iacute;&#8216;a,
was chieftain of the Ban&uacute; Taghlib, a powerful tribe which divided
with their kinsmen, the Ban&uacute; Bakr, a vast tract in <span class="sidenote"> War of
Bas&uacute;s.</span>
north-eastern Arabia, extending from the central
highlands to the Syrian desert. His victory at the
head of a confederacy formed by these tribes and others over the
Yemenite Arabs made him the first man in the peninsula, and soon
his pride became no less proverbial than his power.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> He was

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>56</a></span>

married to &#7716;al&iacute;la, daughter of Murra, of the Ban&uacute; Bakr, and dwelt
in a 'preserve' (<i>&#7717;im&aacute;</i>), where he claimed the sole right of pasturage
for himself and the sons of Murra. His brother-in-law, Jass&aacute;s, had
an aunt named Bas&uacute;s. While living under her nephew's protection
she was joined by a certain Sa&#8216;d, a client of her own people, who
brought with him a she-camel called Sar&aacute;bi.</p></div>

<p>Now it happened that Kulayb, seeing a lark's nest as he walked
on his land, said to the bird, which was screaming and fluttering <span class="sidenote">Kulayb b.
Rab&iacute;&#8216;a and
Jass&aacute;s b. Murra.</span>
distressfully over her eggs, "Have no fear! I will
protect thee." But a short time afterwards he
observed in that place the track of a strange camel
and found the eggs trodden to pieces. Next morning
when he and Jass&aacute;s visited the pasture ground, Kulayb noticed the
she-camel of Sa&#8216;d among his brother-in-law's herd, and conjecturing
that she had destroyed the eggs, cried out to Jass&aacute;s, "Take heed
thou! Take heed! I have pondered something, and were I sure,
I would have done it! May this she-camel never come here again
with this herd!" "By God," exclaimed Jass&aacute;s, "but she shall
come!" and when Kulayb threatened to pierce her udder with an
arrow, Jass&aacute;s retorted, "By the stones of W&aacute;&#8217;il,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> fix thine arrow in
her udder and I will fix my lance in thy backbone!" Then he
drove his camels forth from the <i>&#7717;im&aacute;</i>. Kulayb went home in a
passion, and said to his wife, who sought to discover what ailed
him, "Knowest thou any one who durst defend his client against
me?" She answered, "No one except my brother Jass&aacute;s, if he has
given his word." She did what she could to prevent the quarrel
going further, and for a time nothing worse than taunts passed
between them, until one day Kulayb went to look after his camels
which were being taken to water, and were followed by those of
Jass&aacute;s. While the latter were waiting their turn to <span class="sidenote">The wounding
of Sa&#8216;d's
she-camel.</span>
drink, Sa&#8216;d's she-camel broke loose and ran towards
the water. Kulayb imagined that Jass&aacute;s had let her
go deliberately, and resenting the supposed insult, he
seized his bow and shot her through the udder. The beast lay
down, moaning loudly, before the tent of Bas&uacute;s, who in vehement
indignation at the wrong suffered by her friend, Sa&#8216;d, tore the veil
from her head, beating her face and crying, "O shame, shame!"
Then, addressing Sa&#8216;d, but raising her voice so that Jass&aacute;s might

(<i>al-Muwaththib&aacute;t</i>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>Jass&aacute;s was stung to the quick by the imputation, which no Arab
can endure, that injury and insult might be inflicted upon his guest-friend
with impunity. Some days afterwards, having ascertained
that Kulayb had gone out unarmed, he followed and slew him, and
fled in haste to his own people. Murra, when he heard the news,
said to his son, "Thou alone must answer for thy deed: thou shalt
be put in chains that his kinsmen may slay thee. By the stones of
W&aacute;&#8217;il, never will Bakr and Taghlib be joined together <span class="sidenote"> Kulayb
murdered by
Jass&aacute;s.</span>
in welfare after the death of Kulayb. Verily, an evil
thing hast thou brought upon thy people, O Jass&aacute;s!
Thou hast slain their chief and severed their union
and cast war into their midst." So he put Jass&aacute;s in chains and confined
him in a tent; then he summoned the elders of the families
and asked them, "What do ye say concerning Jass&aacute;s? Here he is,
a prisoner, until the avengers demand him and we deliver him unto
them." "No, by God," cried Sa&#8216;d b. M&aacute;lik b. &#7692;ubay&#8216;a b. Qays, "we
will not give him up, but will fight for him to the last man!" With
these words he called for a camel to be sacrificed, and when its
throat was cut they swore to one another over the blood. Thereupon
Murra said to Jass&aacute;s:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus began the War of Bas&uacute;s between Taghlib on the one side
and the clan of Shayb&aacute;n, to which Murra belonged, on the other; <span class="sidenote"> Outbreak of
war between
Taghlib and
Bakr.</span>
for at first the remaining divisions of Bakr held aloof
from the struggle, considering Shayb&aacute;n to be clearly
in the wrong. The latter were reduced to dire straits,
when an event occurred which caused the Bakrites
to rise as one man on behalf of their fellows. &#7716;&aacute;rith b.&#8216;Ub&aacute;d,
a famous knight of Bakr, had refused to take part in the contest,
saying in words which became proverbial, "I have neither camel
nor she-camel in it," <i>i.e.</i>, "it is no affair of mine." One day his
nephew, Bujayr, encountered Kulayb's brother, Muhalhil, on whom
the mantle of the murdered chief had fallen; and Muhalhil, struck
with admiration for the youth's comeliness, asked him who he was.
"Bujayr," said he, "the son of &#8216;Amr, the son of &#8216;Ub&aacute;d." "And
who is thy uncle on the mother's side?" "My mother is a captive"
(for he would not name an uncle of whom he had no honour).
Then Muhalhil slew him, crying, "Pay for Kulayb's shoe-latchet!"
On hearing this, &#7716;&aacute;rith sent a message to Muhalhil in which he
declared that if vengeance were satisfied by the death of Bujayr,
he for his part would gladly acquiesce. But Muhalhil replied, "I
have taken satisfaction only for Kulayb's shoe-latchet." Thereupon
&#7716;&aacute;rith sprang up in wrath and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Ban&uacute; Bakr now prepared for a decisive battle. As their
enemy had the advantage in numbers, they adopted a stratagem
devised by &#7716;&aacute;rith. "Fight them," said he, "with your women.
Equip every woman with a small waterskin and give her a club.
Place the whole body of them behind you&mdash;this will make you more
resolved in battle&mdash;and wear some distinguishing mark which they
will recognise, so that when a woman passes by one of your
wounded she may know him by his mark and give him water to
drink, and raise him from the ground; but when she passes by one
of your foes she will smite him with her club and slay him." So the
Bakrites shaved their heads, devoting themselves to <span class="sidenote"> The Day of
Shearing.</span>
death, and made this a mark of recognition between
themselves and their women, and this day was called
the Day of Shearing. Now Ja&#7717;dar b. &#7692;ubay&#8216;a was an ill-favoured,
dwarfish man, with fair flowing love-locks, and he said, "O my
people, if ye shave my head ye will disfigure me, so leave my locks
for the first horseman of Taghlib that shall emerge from the hill-pass
on the morrow" (meaning "I will answer for him, if my locks are
spared"). On his request being granted, he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>He kept his promise but in the course of the fight he fell, severely

<p>The mothers were accompanied by their children, whose tender
age did not always protect them from an exasperated foe. It is
related that a horseman of the Ban&uacute; Taghlib transfixed a young boy
and lifted him up on the point of his spear. He is said to have been
urged to this act of savagery by one al-Bazb&aacute;z, who was riding
behind him on the crupper. Their triumph was short; al-Find saw
them, and with a single spear-thrust pinned them to each other&mdash;an
exploit which his own verses record.</p>

<p>On this day the Ban&uacute; Bakr gained a great victory, and broke the
power of Taghlib. It was the last battle of note in the Forty
Years' War, which was carried on, by raiding and plundering, until
the exhaustion of both tribes and the influence of King Mundhir III
of &#7716;&iacute;ra brought it to an end.</p>

Bakr and Taghlib, another war, hardly less famous in tradition <span class="sidenote"> The War of
D&aacute;&#7717;is and
Ghabr&aacute;.</span>
than the War of Bas&uacute;s, broke out in Central Arabia. The
combatants were the tribes of &#8216;Abs and Dhuby&aacute;n,
the principal stocks of the Ban&uacute; Gha&#7789;af&aacute;n,
and the occasion of their coming to blows is
related as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Qays, son of Zuhayr, was chieftain of &#8216;Abs. He had a horse
called D&aacute;&#7717;is, renowned for its speed, which he matched against
Ghabr&aacute;, a mare belonging to &#7716;udhayfa b. Badr, the chief of
Dhuby&aacute;n. It was agreed that the course should be a hundred
bow-shots in length, and that the victor should receive a hundred
camels. When the race began Ghabr&aacute; took the lead, but as they
left the firm ground and entered upon the sand, where the 'going'
was heavy, D&aacute;&#7717;is gradually drew level and passed his antagonist.
He was nearing the goal when some Dhuby&aacute;nites sprang from an
ambuscade prepared beforehand, and drove him out of his course,
thus enabling Ghabr&aacute; to defeat him. On being informed of this
foul play Qays naturally claimed that he had won the wager, but
the men of Dhuby&aacute;n refused to pay even a single camel. Bitterly
resenting their treachery, he waylaid and slew one of &#7716;udhayfa's
brothers. &#7716;udhayfa sought vengeance, and the murder of M&aacute;lik,
a brother of Qays, by his horsemen gave the signal for war. In the
fighting which ensued Dhuby&aacute;n more than held their own, but
neither party could obtain a decisive advantage. Qays slew the
brothers &#7716;udhayfa and &#7716;amal&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"<i>&#7716;amal I slew and eased my heart thereby,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>&#7716;udhayfa glutted my avenging brand;</i></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>After a long period&mdash;forty years according to the traditional
computation&mdash;&#8216;Abs and Dhuby&aacute;n were reconciled by the exertions
of two chieftains of the latter tribe, &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#8216;Awf and Harim b.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>62</a></span>

Sin&aacute;n, whose generous and patriotic intervention the poet Zuhayr
has celebrated. Qays went into exile. "I will not look," he said,
"on the face of any woman of Dhuby&aacute;n whose father or brother or
husband or son I have killed." If we may believe the legend, he
became a Christian monk and ended his days in &#8216;Um&aacute;n.</p></div>

<p>Descending westward from the highlands of Najd the
traveller gradually approaches the Red Sea, which is separated
from the mountains running parallel to it by a <span class="sidenote"> The &#7716;ij&aacute;z.</span>
narrow strip of coast-land, called the Tih&aacute;ma
(Netherland). The rugged plateau between Najd and the
coast forms the &#7716;ij&aacute;z (Barrier), through which in ancient
times the Sab&aelig;an caravans laden with costly merchandise
passed on their way to the Mediterranean ports. Long before
the beginning of our era two considerable trading settlements
had sprung up in this region, viz., Macoraba (Mecca) and,
some distance farther north, Yathrippa (Yathrib, the Pre-islamic
name of Med&iacute;na). Of their early inhabitants and
history we know nothing except what is related by Mu&#7717;ammadan
writers, whose information reaches back to the days of
Adam and Abraham. Mecca was the cradle of Islam, and
Islam, according to Mu&#7717;ammad, is the religion of Abraham,
which was corrupted by succeeding generations until he himself
was sent to purify it and to preach it anew. Consequently
the Pre-islamic history of Mecca has all been, so to speak,
'Islamised.' The Holy City of Islam is made to appear in
the same light thousands of years before the Prophet's time:
here, it is said, the Arabs were united in worship of Allah,
hence they scattered and fell into idolatry, hither they return
annually as pilgrims to a shrine which had been originally
dedicated to the One Supreme Being, but which afterwards
became a Pantheon of tribal deities. This theory lies at the
root of the Mu&#7717;ammadan legend which I shall now recount
as briefly as possible, only touching on the salient points of
interest.</p>

<p>In the Meccan valley&mdash;the primitive home of that portion

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#"><span><i>EARLY HISTORY OF MECCA</i></span>63</a></span>

of the Arab race which claims descent from Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l (Ishmael),
the son of Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m (Abraham) by H&aacute;jar (Hagar)&mdash;stands an
irregular, cube-shaped building of small dimensions&mdash;the
Ka&#8216;ba. Legend attributes its foundation <span class="sidenote">Foundation of
the Ka&#8216;ba.</span>
to Adam, who built it by Divine command after
a celestial archetype. At the Deluge it was taken up into
heaven, but was rebuilt on its former site by Abraham and
Ishmael. While they were occupied in this work Gabriel
brought the celebrated Black Stone, which is set in the south-east
corner of the building, and he also instructed them in the
ceremonies of the Pilgrimage. When all was finished Abraham
stood on a rock known to later ages as the <i>Maq&aacute;mu Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m</i>,
and, turning to the four quarters of the sky, made proclamation:
"O ye people! The Pilgrimage to the Ancient House
is prescribed unto you. Hearken to your Lord!" And
from every part of the world came the answer: "<i>Labbayka
&#8217;ll&aacute;humma, labbayka</i>"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, "We obey, O God, we obey."</p>

<p>The descendants of Ishmael multiplied exceedingly, so that
the barren valley could no longer support them, and a great
number wandered forth to other lands. They were succeeded
as rulers of the sacred territory by the tribe of Jurhum, who
waxed in pride and evil-doing until the vengeance of God fell
upon them. Mention has frequently been made of the Bursting
of the Dyke of Ma&#8217;rib, which caused an extensive movement
of Yemenite stocks to the north. The invaders halted
in the &#7716;ij&aacute;z and, having almost exterminated the Jurhumites,
resumed their journey. One group, however&mdash;the Ban&uacute;
Khuz&aacute;&#8216;a, led by their chief Lu&#7717;ayy&mdash;settled in the neighbourhood
of Mecca. &#8216;Amr, son of Lu&#7717;ayy, was renowned
among the Arabs for his wealth and generosity. Ibn Hish&aacute;m
says: 'I have been told by a learned man that &#8216;Amr b. Lu&#7717;ayy
went from Mecca to Syria on some business <span class="sidenote"> Idolatry introduced
at Mecca.</span>
and when he arrived at M&aacute;&#8217;ab, in the land
of al-Balq&aacute;, he found the inhabitants, who were
&#8216;Am&aacute;l&iacute;q, worshipping idols. "What are these idols?" he inquired.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>64</a></span>

"They are idols that send us rain when we ask them
for rain, and help us when we ask them for help." "Will ye
not give me one of them," said &#8216;Amr, "that I may take it to
Arabia to be worshipped there?" So they gave him an idol
called Hubal, which he brought to Mecca and set it up and
bade the people worship and venerate it.'<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Following his
example, the Arabs brought their idols and installed them
round the sanctuary. The triumph of Paganism was complete.
We are told that hundreds of idols were destroyed by
Mu&#7717;ammad when he entered Mecca at the head of a Moslem
army in 8 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 629 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>To return to the posterity of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l through &#8216;Adn&aacute;n: the
principal of their descendants who remained in the &#7716;ij&aacute;z were <span class="sidenote"> The Quraysh.</span>
the Hudhayl, the Kin&aacute;na, and the Quraysh. The
last-named tribe must now engage our attention
almost exclusively. During the century before Mu&#7717;ammad
we find them in undisputed possession of Mecca and acknowledged
guardians of the Ka&#8216;ba&mdash;an office which they administered
with a shrewd appreciation of its commercial value.
Their rise to power is related as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Kil&aacute;b b. Murra, a man of Quraysh, had two sons, Zuhra and Zayd.
The latter was still a young child when his father died, and soon
afterwards his mother, F&aacute;&#7789;ima, who had married again, <span class="sidenote"> The story of
Qu&#7779;ayy.</span>
left Mecca, taking Zayd with her, and went to live in
her new husband's home beside the Syrian borders.
Zayd grew up far from his native land, and for this reason he got
the name of Qu&#7779;ayy&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 'Little Far-away.' When he reached
man's estate and discovered his true origin he returned to Mecca,
where the hegemony was wholly in the hands of the Khuz&aacute;&#8216;ites
under their chieftain, &#7716;ulayl b. &#7716;ubshiyya, with the determination
to procure the superintendence of the Ka&#8216;ba for his own people, the
Quraysh, who as pure-blooded descendants of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l had the best
right to that honour. By his marriage with &#7716;ubb&aacute;, the daughter of
&#7716;ulayl, he hoped to inherit the privileges vested in his father-in-law,
but &#7716;ulayl on his deathbed committed the keys of the Ka&#8216;ba to a

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#"><span><i>THE QURAYSH</i></span>65</a></span>

kinsman named Ab&uacute; Ghubsh&aacute;n. Not to be baffled, Qu&#7779;ayy made
the keeper drunk and persuaded him to sell the keys for a skin of
wine&mdash;hence the proverbs "A greater fool than Ab&uacute; Ghubsh&aacute;n"
and "Ab&uacute; Ghubsh&aacute;n's bargain," denoting a miserable fraud.
Naturally the Khuza&#8216;ites did not acquiesce in the results of this
transaction; they took up arms, but Qu&#7779;ayy was prepared for the
struggle and won a decisive victory. He was now master of Temple
and Town and could proceed to the work of organisation. His first
step was to bring together the Quraysh, who had <span class="sidenote"> Qu&#7779;ayy master
of Mecca.</span>
previously been dispersed over a wide area, into the
Meccan valley&mdash;this earned for him the title of <i>al-Mujammi&#8216;</i>
(the Congregator)&mdash;so that each family had its allotted
quarter. He built a House of Assembly (<i>D&aacute;ru &#8217;l-Nadwa</i>), where
matters affecting the common weal were discussed by the Elders of
the tribe. He also instituted and centred in himself a number of
dignities in connection with the government of the Ka&#8216;ba and the
administration of the Pilgrimage, besides others of a political and
military character. Such was his authority that after his death, no
less than during his life, all these ordinances were regarded by the
Quraysh as sacred and inviolable.</p></div>

<p>The death of Qu&#7779;ayy may be placed in the latter half of the
fifth century. His descendant, the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad, was <span class="sidenote"> Mecca in the
sixth century
after Christ.</span>
born about a hundred years afterwards, in 570 or
571 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> With one notable exception, to be
mentioned immediately, the history of Mecca
during the period thus defined is a record of petty factions
unbroken by any event of importance. The Prophet's
ancestors fill the stage and assume a commanding position,
which in all likelihood they never possessed; the historical
rivalry of the Umayyads and &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids appears in the persons
of their founders, Umayya and H&aacute;shim&mdash;and so forth. Meanwhile
the influence of the Quraysh was steadily maintained
and extended. The Ka&#8216;ba had become a great national
rendezvous, and the crowds of pilgrims which it attracted
from almost every Arabian clan not only raised the credit of
the Quraysh, but also materially contributed to their commercial
prosperity. It has already been related how Abraha,
the Abyssinian viceroy of Yemen, resolved to march against

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#"><span><i>THE LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS</i></span>66</a></span>

Mecca with the avowed purpose of avenging upon the Ka&#8216;ba
a sacrilege committed by one of the Quraysh in the church
at &#7778;an&#8216;&aacute;. Something of that kind may have served as a
pretext, but no doubt his real aim was to conquer Mecca and
to gain control of her trade.</p>

<p>This memorable expedition<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> is said by Moslem historians
to have taken place in the year of Mu&#7717;ammad's birth (about <span class="sidenote"> The Year of
the Elephant.</span>
570 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), usually known as the Year of the
Elephant&mdash;a proof that the Arabs were deeply
impressed by the extraordinary spectacle of these
huge animals, one or more of which accompanied the
Abyssinian force. The report of Abraha's preparations filled
the tribesmen with dismay. At first they endeavoured to
oppose his march, regarding the defence of the Ka&#8216;ba as a
sacred duty, but they soon lost heart, and Abraha, after
defeating Dh&uacute; Nafar, a &#7716;imyarite chieftain, encamped in the
neighbourhood of Mecca without further resistance. He sent
the following message to &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib, the <span class="sidenote"> The Abyssinians
at Mecca.</span>
Prophet's grandfather, who was at that time the
most influential personage in Mecca: "I have
not come to wage war on you, but only to destroy the
Temple. Unless you take up arms in its defence, I have
no wish to shed your blood." &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib replied:
"By God, we seek not war, for which we are unable. This
is God's holy House and the House of Abraham, His Friend;
it is for Him to protect His House and Sanctuary; if He
abandons it, we cannot defend it."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Then &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib was conducted by the envoy to the
Abyssinian camp, as Abraha had ordered. There he inquired after
Dh&uacute; Nafar, who was his friend, and found him a <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib's
interview
with Abraha.</span>
prisoner. "O Dh&uacute; Nafar," said he, "can you do
aught in that which has befallen us?" Dh&uacute; Nafar
answered, "What can a man do who is a captive in the hands of a

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#"><span><i>THE ABYSSINIAN INVASION</i></span>67</a></span>

king, expecting day and night to be put to death? I can do nothing
at all in the matter, but Unays, the elephant-driver, is my friend; I
will send to him and press your claims on his consideration and ask
him to procure you an audience with the king. Tell Unays what
you wish: he will plead with the king in your favour if he can."
So Dh&uacute; Nafar sent for Unays and said to him, "O Unays, &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib is lord of Quraysh and master of the caravans of Mecca.
He feeds the people in the plain and the wild creatures on the
mountain-tops. The king has seized two hundred of his camels.
Now get him admitted to the king's presence and help him to the
best of your power." Unays consented, and soon &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib
stood before the king. When Abraha saw him he held him in too
high respect to let him sit in an inferior place, but was unwilling
that the Abyssinians should see the Arab chief, who was a large
man and a comely, seated on a level with himself; he therefore
descended from his throne and sat on his carpet and bade &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib sit beside him. Then he said to his dragoman, "Ask
him what he wants of me." &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib replied, "I want the
king to restore to me two hundred camels of mine which he has
taken away." Abraha said to the dragoman, "Tell him: You
pleased me when I first saw you, but now that you have spoken to
me I hold you cheap. What! do you speak to me of two hundred
camels which I have taken, and omit to speak of a temple venerated
by you and your fathers which I have come to destroy?" Then said
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib: "The camels are mine, but the Temple belongs
to another, who will defend it," and on the king exclaiming, "He
cannot defend it from me," he said, "That is your affair; only give
me back my camels."</p>

<p>As it is related in a more credible version, the tribes settled round
Mecca sent ambassadors, of whom &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib was one, offering
to surrender a third part of their possessions to Abraha on condition
that he should spare the Temple, but he refused. Having
recovered his camels, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib returned to the Quraysh,
told them what had happened, and bade them leave the city and
take shelter in the mountains. Then he went to the Ka&#8216;ba, accompanied
by several of the Quraysh, to pray for help against Abraha
and his army. Grasping the ring of the door, he cried:&mdash;</p></div>

elephant knelt down and would not budge, though they beat its

they turned it in the direction of Yemen, it rose up and trotted with
alacrity. Then God sent from the sea a flock of birds like swallows
every one of which carried three stones as large as a <span class="sidenote"> Rout of the

<p>The part played by &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib in the story is, of
course, a pious fiction designed to glorify the Holy City and
to claim for the Prophet's family fifty years before Islam a
predominance which they did not obtain until long afterwards;
but equally of course the legend reflects Mu&#7717;ammadan belief,
and may be studied with advantage as a characteristic specimen
of its class.</p>

<p>The patriotic feelings aroused in the Arabs of the &#7716;ij&aacute;z
by the Abyssinian invasion&mdash;feelings which must have been
shared to some extent by the Bedouins generally&mdash;received a
fresh stimulus through events which occurred about forty years
after this time on the other side of the peninsula. It will be
remembered that the Lakhmite dynasty at &#7716;&iacute;ra came to an

in the dust.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>

<h5>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY, MANNERS, AND RELIGION</h5>

<p>"When there appeared a poet in a family of the Arabs, the
other tribes round about would gather together to that family
and wish them joy of their good luck. Feasts would be got
ready, the women of the tribe would join together in bands,
playing upon lutes, as they were wont to do at bridals, and the
men and boys would congratulate one another; for a poet was
a defence to the honour of them all, a weapon to ward off
insult from their good name, and a means of perpetuating their
glorious deeds and of establishing their fame for ever. And
they used not to wish one another joy but for three things&mdash;the
birth of a boy, the coming to light of a poet, and the
foaling of a noble mare."<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>As far as extant literature is concerned&mdash;and at this time
there was only a spoken literature, which was preserved by
oral tradition, and first committed to writing long afterwards&mdash;the
<i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i> or Pre-islamic Age covers scarcely more than
a century, from about 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when the oldest poems of
which we have any record were composed, to the year of
Mu&#7717;ammad's Flight to Med&iacute;na (622 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), which is the
starting-point of a new era in Arabian history. The influence
of these hundred and twenty years was great and lasting.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>72</a></span>

They saw the rise and incipient decline of a poetry which
most Arabic-speaking Moslems have always regarded as a
model of unapproachable excellence; a poetry rooted in the
life of the people, that insensibly moulded their minds and
fixed their character and made them morally and spiritually a
nation long before Mu&#7717;ammad welded the various conflicting
groups into a single organism, animated, for some time at
least, by a common purpose. In those days poetry was no
luxury for the cultured few, but the sole medium of literary
expression. Every tribe had its poets, who freely uttered what
they felt and thought. Their unwritten words "flew across
the desert faster than arrows," and came home to the hearts
and bosoms of all who heard them. Thus in the midst of
outward strife and disintegration a unifying principle was at
work. Poetry gave life and currency to an ideal of Arabian
virtue (<i>muruwwa</i>), which, though based on tribal community
of blood and insisting that only ties of blood were sacred,
nevertheless became an invisible bond between diverse clans,
and formed, whether consciously or not, the basis of a national
community of sentiment.</p>

<p>In the following pages I propose to trace the origins of
<span class="sidenote">Origins of Arabian Poetry</span>Arabian poetry, to describe its form, contents, and general
features, to give some account of the most celebrated
Pre-islamic poets and collections of Pre-islamic
verse, and finally to show in what manner
it was preserved and handed down.</p>

<p>By the ancient Arabs the poet (<i>sh&aacute;&#8216;ir</i>, plural <i>shu&#8216;ar&aacute;</i>), as his
name implies, was held to be a person endowed with supernatural
knowledge, a wizard in league with spirits (<i>jinn</i>) or
satans (<i>shay&aacute;&#7789;&iacute;n</i>) and dependent on them for the magical
powers which he displayed. This view of his personality,
as well as the influential position which he occupied, are curiously
indicated by the story of a certain youth who was refused
the hand of his beloved on the ground that he was neither a poet

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#"><span><i>THE POET AS A WIZARD</i></span>73</a></span>

nor a soothsayer nor a water-diviner.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The idea of poetry as
an art was developed afterwards; the pagan <i>sh&aacute;&#8216;ir</i> is the oracle
of his tribe, their guide in peace and their champion in war.
It was to him they turned for counsel when they sought new
pastures, only at his word would they pitch or strike their 'houses
of hair,' and when the tired and thirsty wanderers found a well
and drank of its water and washed themselves, led by him they
may have raised their voices together and sung, like Israel&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
"Spring up, O well, sing ye unto it."<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides fountain-songs, war-songs, and hymns to idols,
other kinds of poetry must have existed in the earliest times&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
the love-song and the dirge. The powers of the <i>sh&aacute;&#8216;ir</i>,
however, were chiefly exhibited in Satire (<i>hij&aacute;</i>), which in the <span class="sidenote"> Satire.</span>
oldest known form "introduces and accompanies the tribal
feud, and is an element of war just as important
as the actual fighting."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> The menaces which he
hurled against the foe were believed to be inevitably fatal.
His rhymes, often compared to arrows, had all the effect of a
solemn curse spoken by a divinely inspired prophet or priest,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
and their pronunciation was attended with peculiar ceremonies
of a symbolic character, such as anointing the hair on one side
of the head, letting the mantle hang down loosely, and wearing
only one sandal.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Satire retained something of these
ominous associations at a much later period when the magic
utterance of the <i>sh&aacute;&#8216;ir</i> had long given place to the lampoon

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>74</a></span>

by which the poet reviles his enemies and holds them up to
shame.</p>

<p>The obscure beginnings of Arabian poetry, presided over
by the magician and his familiar spirits, have left not a <span class="sidenote">Saj&#8216;.</span>
rack behind in the shape of literature, but the task
of reconstruction is comparatively easy where we
are dealing with a people so conservative and tenacious of
antiquity as the Arabs. Thus it may be taken for certain
that the oldest form of poetical speech in Arabia was rhyme
without metre (<i>Saj&#8216;</i>), or, as we should say, 'rhymed prose,'
although the fact of Mu&#7717;ammad's adversaries calling him a
poet because he used it in the Koran shows the light in which
it was regarded even after the invention and elaboration of
metre. Later on, as we shall see, <i>Saj&#8216;</i> became a merely
rhetorical ornament, the distinguishing mark of all eloquence
whether spoken or written, but originally it had a deeper,
almost religious, significance as the special form adopted by
poets, soothsayers, and the like in their supernatural revelations
and for conveying to the vulgar every kind of mysterious and
esoteric lore.</p>

<p>Out of <i>Saj&#8216;</i> was evolved the most ancient of the Arabian
metres, which is known by the name of <i>Rajaz</i>.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> This is an
irregular iambic metre usually consisting of four <span class="sidenote"> Rajaz.</span>
or six&mdash;an Arab would write 'two or three'&mdash;feet
to the line; and it is a peculiarity of <i>Rajaz</i>, marking its
affinity to <i>Saj&#8216;</i>, that all the lines rhyme with each other,
whereas in the more artificial metres only the opening verse<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#"><span><i>ARABIAN METRES</i></span>75</a></span>

is doubly rhymed. A further characteristic of <i>Rajaz</i> is that
it should be uttered extempore, a few verses at a time&mdash;commonly
verses expressing some personal feeling, emotion, or
experience, like those of the aged warrior Durayd b. Zayd b.
Nahd when he lay dying:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i05">"The house of death<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> is builded for Durayd to-day.</span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Here would have been the proper place to give an account
of the principal Arabian metres&mdash;the 'Perfect' (<i>K&aacute;mil</i>), the
'Ample' (<i>W&aacute;fir</i>) the 'Long' (<i>&#7788;aw&iacute;l</i>), the <span class="sidenote"> Other metres.</span>
'Wide' (<i>Basi&#7789;</i>), the 'Light' (<i>Khaf&iacute;f</i>), and
several more&mdash;but in order to save valuable space I must
content myself with referring the reader to the extremely
lucid treatment of this subject by Sir Charles Lyall in the
Introduction to his <i>Ancient Arabian Poetry</i>, pp. xlv-lii. All
the metres are quantitative, as in Greek and Latin. Their
names and laws were unknown to the Pre-islamic bards: the
rules of prosody were first deduced from the ancient poems and
systematised by the grammarian, Khal&iacute;l b. Ahmad (&#8224;&nbsp;791 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
to whom the idea is said to have occurred as he watched a
coppersmith beating time on the anvil with his hammer.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the form and matter of the oldest
extant poems in the Arabic language. Between these highly <span class="sidenote"> The oldest
extant poems.</span>
developed productions and the rude doggerel of
<i>Saj&#8216;</i> or <i>Rajaz</i> there lies an interval, the length of
which it is impossible even to conjecture. The
first poets are already consummate masters of the craft. "The
number and complexity of the measures which they use, their
established laws of quantity and rhyme, and the uniform

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_76" id="Page_76" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>76</a></span>

manner in which they introduce the subject of their poems,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
notwithstanding the distance which often separated one composer
from another, all point to a long previous study and
cultivation of the art of expression and the capacities of their
language, a study of which no record now remains."<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>It is not improbable that the dawn of the Golden Age of
Arabian Poetry coincided with the first decade of the sixth <span class="sidenote"> Their date.</span>
century after Christ. About that time the War
of Bas&uacute;s, the chronicle of which has preserved a
considerable amount of contemporary verse, was in full
blaze; and the first Arabian ode was composed, according
to tradition, by Muhalhil b. Rab&iacute;&#8216;a the Taghlibite on the
death of his brother, the chieftain Kulayb, which caused war
to break out between Bakr and Taghlib. At any rate, during
the next hundred years in almost every part of the peninsula
we meet with a brilliant succession of singers, all using the
same poetical dialect and strictly adhering to the same rules of
composition. The fashion which they set maintained itself
virtually unaltered down to the end of the Umayyad period
(750 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and though challenged by some daring spirits under
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphate, speedily reasserted its supremacy, which
at the present day is almost as absolute as ever.</p>

<p>This fashion centres in the <i>Qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> or Ode, the only
form, or rather the only finished type of poetry that existed

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#"><span><i>THE QA&#7778;&Iacute;DA OR ODE</i></span>77</a></span>

in what, for want of a better word, may be called the classical
period of Arabic literature. The verses (<i>aby&aacute;t</i>, singular <i>bayt</i>)
of which it is built vary in number, but are seldom <span class="sidenote"> The Qa&#7779;&iacute;da.</span>
less than twenty-five or more than a hundred;
and the arrangement of the rhymes is such that, while the two
halves of the first verse rhyme together, the same rhyme is
repeated once in the second, third, and every following verse
to the end of the poem. Blank-verse is alien to the Arabs,
who regard rhyme not as a pleasing ornament or a "troublesome
bondage," but as a vital organ of poetry. The rhymes
are usually feminine, <i>e.g.</i>, sa<i>kh&iacute;n&aacute;</i>, tu<i>l&iacute;n&aacute;</i>, mu<i>h&iacute;n&aacute;</i>; mukh<i>lid&iacute;</i>,
<i>yad&iacute;</i>, &#8216;uw<i>wad&iacute;</i>; ri<i>j&aacute;muh&aacute;</i>, si<i>l&aacute;muh&aacute;</i>, &#7717;a<i>r&aacute;muh&aacute;</i>. To surmount
the difficulties of the monorhyme demands great technical
skill even in a language of which the peculiar formation
renders the supply of rhymes extraordinarily abundant. The
longest of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>, the so-called 'Long Poems,' is
considerably shorter than Gray's <i>Elegy</i>. An Arabian Homer
or Chaucer must have condescended to prose. With respect
to metre the poet may choose any except <i>Rajaz</i>, which is
deemed beneath the dignity of the Ode, but his liberty does
not extend either to the choice of subjects or to the method of
handling them: on the contrary, the course of his ideas is
determined by rigid conventions which he durst not overstep.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have heard," says Ibn Qutayba, "from a man of learning that
the composer of Odes began by mentioning the deserted dwelling-places
and the relics and traces of habitation. Then <span class="sidenote"> Ibn Qutayba's
account of the
contents and
divisions of the
Ode.</span>
he wept and complained and addressed the desolate
encampment, and begged his companion to make a
halt, in order that he might have occasion to speak
of those who had once lived there and afterwards
departed; for the dwellers in tents were different from townsmen or
villagers in respect of coming and going, because they moved from
one water-spring to another, seeking pasture and searching out the
places where rain had fallen. Then to this he linked the erotic
prelude (<i>nas&iacute;b</i>), and bewailed the violence of his love and the
anguish of separation from his mistress and the extremity of his
passion and desire, so as to win the hearts of his hearers and divert

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>78</a></span>

their eyes towards him and invite their ears to listen to him, since
the song of love touches men's souls and takes hold of their hearts,
God having put it in the constitution of His creatures to love dalliance
and the society of women, in such wise that we find very few but
are attached thereto by some tie or have some share therein, whether
lawful or unpermitted. Now, when the poet had assured himself of
an attentive hearing, he followed up his advantage and set forth his
claim: thus he went on to complain of fatigue and want of sleep
and travelling by night and of the noonday heat, and how his camel
had been reduced to leanness. And when, after representing all the
discomfort and danger of his journey, he knew that he had fully
justified his hope and expectation of receiving his due meed from
the person to whom the poem was addressed, he entered upon the
panegyric (<i>mad&iacute;&#7717;</i>), and incited him to reward, and kindled his
generosity by exalting him above his peers and pronouncing the
greatest dignity, in comparison with his, to be little."<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p></div>

<p>Hundreds of Odes answer exactly to this description, which
must not, however, be regarded as the invariable model. The
erotic prelude is often omitted, especially in elegies; or if it
does not lead directly to the main subject, it may be followed
by a faithful and minute delineation of the poet's horse or
camel which bears him through the wilderness with a speed
like that of the antelope, the wild ass, or the ostrich: Bedouin
poetry abounds in fine studies of animal life.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The choice of
a motive is left open. Panegyric, no doubt, paid better than
any other, and was therefore the favourite; but in Pre-islamic
times the poet could generally please himself. The <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>
is no organic whole: rather its unity resembles that of a series
of pictures by the same hand or, to employ an Eastern trope,
of pearls various in size and quality threaded on a necklace.</p>

<p>The ancient poetry may be defined as an illustrative criticism

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#"><span><i>SHANFAR&Aacute;</i></span>79</a></span>

of Pre-islamic life and thought. Here the Arab has
drawn himself at full length without embellishment or extenuation.</p>

<p>It is not mere chance that Ab&uacute; Tamm&aacute;m's famous
anthology is called the <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, 'Fortitude,' from the
title of its first chapter, which occupies nearly a half of the
book. '&#7716;am&aacute;sa' denotes the virtues most highly prized by
the Arabs&mdash;bravery in battle, patience in misfortune, persistence
in revenge, protection of the weak and defiance of the
strong; the will, as Tennyson has said,</p>

an ambush of his enemies succeeded in taking him prisoner. In <span class="sidenote"> Shanfar&aacute;.</span>
the struggle one of his hands was hewn off by a sword
stroke, and, taking it in the other, he flung it in the

Then he was overpowered and slain, with one still wanting to make
up his number. As his skull lay bleaching on the ground, a man

<p>These verses admirably describe the rudimentary Arabian
virtues of courage, hardness, and strength. We must now
take a wider survey of the moral ideas on which pagan society
was built, and of which Pre-islamic poetry is at once the promulgation
and the record. There was no written code, no <span class="sidenote"> The old Arabian
points of
honour.</span>
legal or religious sanction&mdash;nothing, in effect, save the binding
force of traditional sentiment and opinion, <i>i.e.</i>,
Honour. What, then, are the salient points of
honour in which Virtue (<i>Muruwwa</i>), as it was
understood by the heathen Arabs, consists?</p>

<p>Courage has been already mentioned. Arab courage is like
that of the ancient Greeks, "dependent upon excitement and
vanishing quickly before depression and delay."<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> <span class="sidenote"> Courage.</span>
Hence the Arab hero is defiant and boastful, as
he appears, <i>e.g.</i>, in the <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> of &#8216;Amr b. Kulth&uacute;m.
When there is little to lose by flight he will ride off unashamed;

were stationed behind the line of battle.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>The chiefs, however, durst not lay commands or penalties on
their fellow-tribesmen. Every man ruled himself, and was
free to rebuke presumption in others. "<i>If you are our lord</i>"
(<i>i.e.</i>, if you act discreetly as a <i>sayyid</i> should), "<i>you will lord

<p>At the same time, notwithstanding their shrewd common
sense, nothing is more characteristic of the Arabs&mdash;heathen
and Mu&#7717;ammadan alike&mdash;than the chivalrous devotion and
disinterested self-sacrifice of which they are capable on behalf
of their friends. In particular, the ancient poetry affords
proof that they regarded with horror any breach of the solemn
covenant plighted between patron and client or host and guest.
This topic might be illustrated by many striking examples, but
one will suffice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Arabs say: "<i>Awf&aacute; mina &#8217;l-Samaw&#8217;ali</i>"&mdash;"More loyal than
al-Samaw&#8217;al"; or <i>Waf&aacute;<sup>un</sup> ka-waf&aacute;&#8217;i &#8217;l-Samaw&#8217;ali</i>"&mdash;" A loyalty like
that of al-Samaw&#8217;al." These proverbs refer to <span class="sidenote">The story of
Samaw&#8217;al b.
&#8216;Adiy&aacute;.</span>
Samaw&#8217;al b. &#8216;Adiy&aacute;, an Arab of Jewish descent and
Jew by religion, who lived in his castle, called al-Ablaq
(The Piebald), at Taym&aacute;, some distance north of
Med&iacute;na. There he dug a well of sweet water, and would entertain
the Arabs who used to alight beside it; and they supplied themselves
with provisions from his castle and set up a market. It is
related that the poet Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays, while fleeing, hotly pursued by
his enemies, towards Syria, took refuge with Samaw&#8217;al, and before
proceeding on his way left in charge of his host five coats of mail
which had been handed down as heirlooms by the princes of his
family. Then he departed, and in due course arrived at Constantinople,
where he besought the Byzantine emperor to help him to

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#"><span><i>SAMAW&#8217;AL B. &#8216;ADIYA</i></span>85</a></span>

recover his lost kingdom. His appeal was not unsuccessful, but he
died on the way home. Meanwhile his old enemy, the King of &#7716;&iacute;ra,
sent an army under &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#7826;&aacute;lim against Samaw&#8217;al, demanding
that he should surrender the coats of mail. Samaw&#8217;al refused to
betray the trust committed to him, and defended himself in his
castle. The besiegers, however, captured his son, who had gone
out to hunt. &#7716;&aacute;rith asked Samaw&#8217;al: "Dost thou know this
lad?" "Yes, he is my son." "Then wilt thou deliver what is
in thy possession, or shall I slay him?" Samaw&#8217;al answered: "Do
with him as thou wilt. I will never break my pledge nor give up
the property of my guest-friend." So &#7716;&aacute;rith smote the lad with his
sword and clove him through the middle. Then he raised the siege.
And Samaw&#8217;al said thereupon:&mdash;</p></div>

<p>The Bedouin ideal of generosity and hospitality is personified
in &#7716;&aacute;tim of &#7788;ayyi&#8217;, of whom many anecdotes are told. We
may learn from the following one how extravagant are an
Arab's notions on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When &#7716;&aacute;tim's mother was pregnant she dreamed that she was
asked, "Which dost thou prefer?&mdash;a generous son called &#7716;&aacute;tim, or
ten like those of other folk, lions in the hour of battle, <span class="sidenote">&#7716;&aacute;tim of &#7788;ayyi&#8217;.</span>
brave lads and strong of limb?" and that she answered,
"&#7716;&aacute;tim." Now, when &#7716;&aacute;tim grew up he was wont
to take out his food, and if he found any one to share it he
would eat, otherwise he threw it away. His father, seeing that

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>86</a></span>

he wasted his food, gave him a slave-girl and a mare with her
foal and sent him to herd the camels. On reaching the pasture,
&#7716;&aacute;tim began to search for his fellows, but none was in sight;
then he came to the road, but found no one there. While he
was thus engaged he descried a party of riders on the road and
went to meet them. "O youth," said they, "hast thou aught to
entertain us withal?" He answered: "Do ye ask me of entertainment
when ye see the camels?" Now, these riders were
&#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. al-Abras and Bishr b. Ab&iacute; Kh&aacute;zim and N&aacute;bigha al-Dhuby&aacute;n&iacute;,
and they were on their way to King Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> &#7716;&aacute;tim
slaughtered three camels for them, whereupon &#8216;Ab&iacute;d said: "We
desired no entertainment save milk, but if thou must needs charge
thyself with something more, a single young she-camel would have
sufficed us." &#7716;&aacute;tim replied: "That I know, but seeing different
faces and diverse fashions I thought ye were not of the same
country, and I wished that each of you should mention what ye
saw, on returning home." So they spoke verses in praise of him
and celebrated his generosity, and &#7716;&aacute;tim said: "I wished to bestow
a kindness upon you, but your bounty is greater than mine. I
swear to God that I will hamstring every camel in the herd unless
ye come forward and divide them among yourselves." The poets
did as he desired, and each man received ninety-nine camels; then
they proceeded on their journey to Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n. When &#7716;&aacute;tim's father
heard of this he came to him and asked, "Where are the camels?"
"O my father," replied &#7716;&aacute;tim, "by means of them I have conferred
on thee everlasting fame and honour that will cleave to thee like the
ring of the ringdove, and men will always bear in mind some verse
of poetry in which we are praised. This is thy recompense for the
camels." On hearing these words his father said, "Didst thou with
my camels thus?" "Yes." "By God, I will never dwell with thee
again." So he went forth with his family, and &#7716;&aacute;tim was left alone
with his slave-girl and his mare and the mare's foal.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p></div>

<p>We are told that &#7716;&aacute;tim's daughter was led as a captive
before the Prophet and thus addressed him: "'O Mu&#7717;ammad,
my sire is dead, and he who would have come to plead for me
is gone. Release me, if it seem good to thee, and do not let the
Arabs rejoice at my misfortune; for I am the daughter of

captive, and protect those near and dear to him, and entertain

the guest, and satisfy the hungry, and console the afflicted, and
give food and greeting to all; and never did he turn away
any who sought a boon. I am &#7716;&aacute;tim's daughter.' <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;&aacute;tim's
daughter before

The Prophet (on whom be the blessing
and peace of God) answered her: 'O maiden,

father been an Islamite, verily we should have said, "God have

<p>Here it will be convenient to make a short digression in
order that the reader may obtain, if not a complete view, at
least some glimpses of the position and influence <span class="sidenote"> Position of
women.</span>
of women in Pre-islamic society. On the whole,
their position was high and their influence great.
They were free to choose their husbands, and could return, if
ill-treated or displeased, to their own people; in some cases

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_88" id="Page_88" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>88</a></span>

they even offered themselves in marriage and had the right of
divorce. They were regarded not as slaves and chattels, but as
equals and companions. They inspired the poet to sing and
the warrior to fight. The chivalry of the Middle Ages is,
perhaps, ultimately traceable to heathen Arabia. "Knight-errantry,
the riding forth on horseback in search of adventures,
the rescue of captive maidens, the succour rendered everywhere
to women in adversity&mdash;all these were essentially Arabian
ideas, as was the very name of <i>chivalry</i>, the connection of
honourable conduct with the horse-rider, the man of noble
blood, the cavalier."<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> But the nobility of the women is not
only reflected in the heroism and devotion of the men; it
stands recorded in song, in legend, and in history. F&aacute;&#7789;ima,
the daughter of Khurshub, was one of three noble matrons
who bore the title <i>al-Munjib&aacute;t</i>, 'the Mothers <span class="sidenote"> Arabian
heroines.</span>
of Heroes.' She had seven sons, three of whom,
viz., Rab&iacute;&#8216; and &#8216;Um&aacute;ra and Anas, were called
'the Perfect' (<i>al-Kamala</i>). One day &#7716;amal b. Badr the
Faz&aacute;rite raided the Ban&uacute; &#8216;Abs, the tribe to which F&aacute;&#7789;ima
belonged, and made her his prisoner. As he led away the
camel on which she was mounted at the time, she cried:
"Man, thy wits are wandering. By God, if thou take me
captive, and if we leave behind us this hill which is now
in front of us, surely there will never be peace <span class="sidenote">F&aacute;&#7789;ima
daughter of
Khurshub.</span>
between thee and the sons of Ziy&aacute;d" (Ziy&aacute;d was
the name of her husband), "because people will
say what they please, and the mere suspicion of evil is
enough." "I will carry thee off," said he, "that thou mayest
herd my camels." When F&aacute;&#7789;ima knew that she was certainly
his prisoner she threw herself headlong from her camel and
died; so did she fear to bring dishonour on her sons.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Among

those of two women, Fukayha and Umm Jam&iacute;l. As to
Fukayha, it is related that her clansmen, having been raided by
the brigand Sulayk b. Sulaka, resolved to attack <span class="sidenote"> Fukayha.</span>
him; but since he was a famous runner, on the
advice of one of their shaykhs they waited until he had gone
down to the water and quenched his thirst, for they knew that
he would then be unable to run. Sulayk, however, seeing
himself caught, made for the nearest tents and sought refuge
with Fukayha. She threw her smock over him, and stood
with drawn sword between him and his pursuers; and as they
still pressed on, she tore the veil from her hair and shouted for
help. Then her brothers came and defended Sulayk, so that
his life was saved.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Had space allowed, it would have been a
pleasant task to make some further extracts from the long
Legend of Noble Women. I have illustrated their keen
sense of honour and loyalty, but I might equally well have
chosen examples of gracious dignity and quick intelligence and
passionate affection. Many among them had the gift of
poetry, which they bestowed especially on the dead; it is
a final proof of the high character and position of women in
Pre-islamic Arabia that the hero's mother and sisters were
deemed most worthy to mourn and praise him. The praise of
living women by their lovers necessarily takes a different tone;
the physical charms of the heroine are fully described, but we
seldom find any appreciation of moral beauty. One notable
exception to this rule occurs at the beginning of an ode by
Shanfar&aacute;. The passage defies translation. It is, to quote Sir
Charles Lyall, with whose faithful and sympathetic rendering
of the ancient poetry every student of Arabic literature should
be acquainted, "the most lovely picture of womanhood which
heathen Arabia has left us, drawn by the same hand that has
given us, in the unrivalled <i>L&acirc;m&icirc;yah</i>, its highest ideal of heroic
hardness and virile strength."<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>Only in the freedom of the desert could the character thus
exquisitely delineated bloom and ripen. These verses, taken
by themselves, are a sufficient answer to any one who would
maintain that Islam has increased the social influence of

the weaker sex had not often gone to the wall. The custom
which prevailed in the <i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i> of burying female infants
alive, revolting as it appears to us, was due partly to the
frequent famines with which Arabia is afflicted through lack
of rain, and partly to a perverted sense of honour. Fathers

they should incur disgrace in consequence of their daughters
being made prisoners of war. Hence the birth of <span class="sidenote"> Infanticide.</span>

in the Koran: "<i>They attribute daughters unto God&mdash;far be

wrathfully: he hides himself from his people because of the bad

<p>"Odi et amo": these words of the poet might serve as an
epitome of Bedouin ethics. For, if the heathen Arab was, as
we have seen, a good friend to his friends, he had
in the same degree an intense and deadly feeling <span class="sidenote"> Treatment of
enemies.</span>
of hatred towards his enemies. He who did not
strike back when struck was regarded as a coward. No
honourable man could forgive an injury or fail to avenge
it. An Arab, smarting under the loss of some camels driven
off by raiders, said of his kin who refused to help him:&mdash;</p>

<p>Above all, blood called for blood. This obligation lay
heavy on the conscience of the pagan Arabs. Vengeance,
with them, was "almost a physical necessity, <span class="sidenote"> Blood-revenge.</span>
which if it be not obeyed will deprive its
subject of sleep, of appetite, of health." It was a tormenting
thirst which nothing would quench except blood, a disease
of honour which might be described as madness, although
it rarely prevented the sufferer from going to work with
coolness and circumspection. Vengeance was taken upon
the murderer, if possible, or else upon one of his fellow-tribesmen.
Usually this ended the matter, but in some cases
it was the beginning of a regular blood-feud in which the
entire kin of both parties were involved; as, <i>e.g.</i>, the murder of
Kulayb led to the Forty Years' War between Bakr and
Taghlib.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> The slain man's next of kin might accept a
blood-wit (<i>diya</i>), commonly paid in camels&mdash;the coin of
the country&mdash;as atonement for him. If they did so, however,
it was apt to be cast in their teeth that they preferred milk
(<i>i.e.</i>, she-camels) to blood.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> The true Arab feeling is

It was believed that until vengeance had been taken for
the dead man, his spirit appeared above his tomb in the
shape of an owl (<i>h&aacute;ma</i> or <i>&#7779;ad&aacute;</i>), crying "<i>Isq&uacute;n&iacute;</i>" ("Give
me to drink"). But pagan ideas of vengeance were bound up
with the Past far more than with the Future. The shadowy
after-life counted for little or nothing beside the deeply-rooted
memories of fatherly affection, filial piety, and brotherhood
in arms.</p>

<p>Though liable to abuse, the rough-and-ready justice of
the vendetta had a salutary effect in restraining those who
would otherwise have indulged their lawless instincts without
fear of punishment. From our point of view, however, its
interest is not so much that of a primitive institution as of a
pervading element in old Arabian life and literature. Full, or
even adequate, illustration of this topic would carry me far
beyond the limits of my plan. I have therefore selected from
the copious material preserved in the <i>Book of Songs</i> a characteristic
story which tells how Qays b. al-Kha&#7789;&iacute;m took vengeance
on the murderers of his father and his grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is related on the authority of Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda that &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. &#8216;Amr,
the grandfather of Qays, was slain by a man named M&aacute;lik belonging
to the Ban&uacute; &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;&Aacute;mir b. Rab&iacute;&#8216;a b. &#8216;&Aacute;mir b. <span class="sidenote"> The story of the

the Ban&uacute; &#8216;Abd al-Qays who were settled in Hajar.
Kha&#7789;&iacute;m died before avenging his father, &#8216;Ad&iacute;, when
Qays was but a young lad. The mother of Qays, fearing that he
would sally forth to seek vengeance for the blood of his father and
his grandfather and perish, went to a mound of dust beside the
door of their dwelling and laid stones on it, and began to say to
Qays, "This is the grave of thy father and thy grandfather;" and
Qays never doubted but that it was so. He grew up strong in
the arms, and one day he had a tussle with a youth of the Ban&uacute;
&#7826;afar, who said to him: "By God, thou would'st do better to
turn the strength of thine arms against the slayers of thy father and
grandfather instead of putting it forth upon me." "And who are
their slayers?" "Ask thy mother, she will tell thee." So Qays

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#"><span><i>QAYS IBN AL-KHA&#7788;&Iacute;M</i></span>95</a></span>

took his sword and set its hilt on the ground and its edge between
his two breasts, and said to his mother: "Who killed my father and
my grandfather?" "They died as people die, and these are their
graves in the camping-ground." "By God, verily thou wilt tell me
who slew them or I will bear with my whole weight upon this sword
until it cleaves through my back." Then she told him, and Qays
swore that he would never rest until he had slain their slayers. "O
my son," said she, "M&aacute;lik, who killed thy grandfather, is of the
same folk as Khid&aacute;sh b. Zuhayr, and thy father once bestowed
a kindness on Khid&aacute;sh, for which he is grateful. Go, then, to him
and take counsel with him touching thine affair and ask him to help
thee." So Qays set out immediately, and when he came to the
garden where his water-camel was watering his date-palms, he
smote the cord (of the bucket) with his sword and cut it, so that the
bucket dropped into the well. Then he took hold of the camel's
head, and loaded the beast with two sacks of dates, and said:
"Who will care for this old woman" (meaning his mother) "in my
absence? If I die, let him pay her expenses out of this garden, and
on her death it shall be his own; but if I live, my property will
return to me, and he shall have as many of its dates as he wishes to
eat." One of his folk cried, "I am for it," so Qays gave him the
garden and set forth to inquire concerning Khid&aacute;sh. He was told
to look for him at Marr al-&#7826;ahr&aacute;n, but not finding him in his tent, he
alighted beneath a tree, in the shade of which the guests of Khid&aacute;sh
used to shelter, and called to the wife of Khid&aacute;sh, "Is there any
food?" Now, when she came up to him, she admired his comeliness&mdash;for
he was exceeding fair of countenance&mdash;and said: "By
God, we have no fit entertainment for thee, but only dates." He
replied, "I care not, bring out what thou hast." So she sent to him
dates in a large measure (<i>qub&aacute;&#8216;</i>), and Qays took a single date and
ate half of it and put back the other half in the <i>qub&aacute;&#8216;</i>, and gave
orders that the <i>qub&aacute;&#8216;</i> should be brought in to the wife of Khid&aacute;sh;
then he departed on some business. When Khid&aacute;sh returned and
his wife told him the news of Qays, he said, "This is a man who
would render his person sacred."<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> While he sat there with his wife
eating fresh ripe dates, Qays returned on camel-back; and Khid&aacute;sh,
when he saw the foot of the approaching rider, said to his wife, "Is
this thy guest?" "Yes." "'Tis as though his foot were the foot of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>96</a></span>

my good friend, Kha&#7789;&iacute;m the Yathribite." Qays drew nigh, and struck
the tent-rope with the point of his spear, and begged leave to come
in. Having obtained permission, he entered to Khid&aacute;sh and told
his lineage and informed him of what had passed, and asked him to
help and advise him in his affair. Khid&aacute;sh bade him welcome, and
recalled the kindness which he had of his father, and said, "As to
this affair, truly I have been expecting it of thee for some time.
The slayer of thy grandfather is a cousin of mine, and I will
aid thee against him. When we are assembled in our meeting-place,
I will sit beside him and talk with him, and when I strike his
thigh, do thou spring on him and slay him." Qays himself relates:
"Accompanied by Khid&aacute;sh, I approached him until I stood over his
head when Khid&aacute;sh sat with him, and as soon as he struck the man's
thigh I smote his head with a sword named <i>Dhu &#8217;l-Khur&#7779;ayn</i>" (the
Two-ringed). "His folk rushed on me to slay me, but Khid&aacute;sh came
between us, crying, 'Let him alone, for, by God, he has slain none
but the slayer of his grandfather.'" Then Khid&aacute;sh called for one of
his camels and mounted it, and started with Qays to find the
&#8216;Abdite who killed his father. And when they were near Hajar
Khid&aacute;sh advised him to go and inquire after this man, and to say to
him when he discovered him: "I encountered a brigand of thy
people who robbed me of some articles, and on asking who was the
chieftain of his people I was directed to thee. Go with me, then,
that thou mayest take from him my property. If," Khid&aacute;sh
continued, "he follow thee unattended, thou wilt gain thy desire of
him; but should he bid the others go with thee, laugh, and if he
ask why thou laughest, say, 'With us, the noble does not as thou
dost, but when he is called to a brigand of his people, he goes forth
alone with his whip, not with his sword; and the brigand when he
sees him gives him everything that he took, in awe of him.' If he
shall dismiss his friends, thy course is clear; but if he shall refuse
to go without them, bring him to me nevertheless, for I hope that
thou wilt slay both him and them." So Khid&aacute;sh stationed himself
under the shade of a tree, while Qays went to the &#8216;Abdite and
addressed him as Khid&aacute;sh had prompted; and the man's sense of
honour was touched to the quick, so that he sent away his friends
and went with Qays. And when Qays came back to Khid&aacute;sh, the
latter said to him, "Choose, O Qays! Shall I help thee or shall I
take thy place?" Qays answered, "I desire neither of these
alternatives, but if he slay me, let him not slay thee!" Then he
rushed upon him and wounded him in the flank and drove his lance
through the other side, and he fell dead on the spot. When Qays
had finished with him, Khid&aacute;sh said, "If we flee just now, his folk

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_97" id="Page_97" href="#"><span><i>SONGS OF REVENGE</i></span>97</a></span>

will pursue us; but let us go somewhere not far off, for they will
never think that thou hast slain him and stayed in the neighbourhood.
No; they will miss him and follow his track, and when they
find him slain they will start to pursue us in every direction, and will
only return when they have lost hope." So those two entered some
hollows of the sand, and after staying there several days (for it
happened exactly as Khid&aacute;sh had foretold), they came forth when
the pursuit was over, and did not exchange a word until they
reached the abode of Khid&aacute;sh. There Qays parted from him and
returned to his own people.</p></div>

<p>The poems relating to blood-revenge show all that is best and
much that is less admirable in the heathen Arab&mdash;on the one
hand, his courage and resolution, his contempt of death and
fear of dishonour, his single-minded devotion to the dead as to
the living, his deep regard and tender affection for the men of
his own flesh and blood; on the other hand, his implacable
temper, his perfidious cruelty and reckless ferocity in hunting
down the slayers, and his savage, well-nigh inhuman exultation
over the slain. The famous Song or Ballad of Vengeance that
I shall now attempt to render in English verse is usually attributed
to Ta&#8217;abba&#7789;a Sharr<sup>an</sup>,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> although some pronounce <span class="sidenote">Song of

it to be a forgery by Khalaf al-A&#7717;mar,
the reputed author of Shanfar&aacute;'s masterpiece, and
beyond doubt a marvellously skilful imitator of
the ancient bards. Be that as it may, the ballad is utterly
pagan in tone and feeling. Its extraordinary merit was detected
by Goethe, who, after reading it in a Latin translation,
published a German rendering, with some fine criticism of the
poetry, in his <i>West-oestlicher Divan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> I have endeavoured to
suggest as far as possible the metre and rhythm of the original,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_98" id="Page_98" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>98</a></span>

since to these, in my opinion, its peculiar effect is largely due.
The metre is that known as the 'Tall' (<i>Mad&iacute;d</i>), viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of course, Arabic prosody differs radically from English,
but <i>mutatis mutandis</i> several couplets in the following version
(<i>e.g.</i> the third, eighth, and ninth) will be found to correspond
exactly with their model. As has been said, however, my
object was merely to suggest the abrupt metre and the heavy,
emphatic cadences, so that I have been able to give variety to
the verse, and at the same time to retain that artistic freedom
without which the translator of poetry cannot hope to satisfy
either himself or any one else.</p>

or acquired, but as hereditary possessions which a <span class="sidenote"> Honour conferred

man derived from his ancestors, and held in trust
that he might transmit them untarnished to his
descendants. It is the desire to uphold and emulate the
fame of his forbears, rather than the hope of winning
immortality for himself, that causes the Arab "to say the
say and do the deeds of the noble." Far from sharing the

<p class="tb">It was my intention to add here some general remarks on
Arabian poetry as compared with that of the Hebrews, the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#"><span><i>THE MU&#8216;ALLAQ&Aacute;T</i></span>101</a></span>

Persians, and our own, but since example is better than precept
I will now turn directly to those celebrated odes which are
well known by the title of <i>Mu&#8216;-allaq&aacute;t</i>, or 'Suspended Poems,'
to all who take the slightest interest in Arabic literature.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p><i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> (plural, <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>) "is most likely derived from
the word <i>&#8216;ilq</i>, meaning 'a precious thing or a thing held in
high estimation,' either because one 'hangs on' tenaciously to
it, or because it is 'hung up' in a place of honour, or in a
conspicuous place, in a treasury or storehouse."<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> In course
of time the exact signification of <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> was forgotten, and
it became necessary to find a plausible explanation. <span class="sidenote">The Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t,
or 'Suspended
Poems.'</span>
Hence arose the legend, which frequent repetition
has made familiar, that the 'Suspended Poems'
were so called from having been hung up in the Ka&#8216;ba on
account of their merit; that this distinction was awarded
by the judges at the fair of &#8216;Uk&aacute;&#7827;, near Mecca, where
poets met in rivalry and recited their choicest productions;
and that the successful compositions, before being affixed
to the door of the Ka&#8216;ba, were transcribed in letters of
gold upon pieces of fine Egyptian linen.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> Were these statements

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>102</a></span>

true, we should expect them to be confirmed by some
allusion in the early literature. But as a matter of fact nothing
of the kind is mentioned in the Koran or in religious tradition,
in the ancient histories of Mecca, or in such works as the
<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, which draw their information from old and
trustworthy sources.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Almost the first authority who refers to
the legend is the grammarian A&#7717;mad al-Na&#7717;&#7717;&aacute;s; (&#8224;&nbsp;949 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
and by him it is stigmatised as entirely groundless. Moreover,
although it was accepted by scholars like Reiske, Sir W. Jones,
and even De Sacy, it is incredible in itself. Hengstenberg, in
the Prolegomena to his edition of the <i>Mu&#8216;-allaqa</i> of Imru&#8217;u
&#8217;l-Qays (Bonn, 1823) asked some pertinent questions: Who
were the judges, and how were they appointed? Why were
only these seven poems thus distinguished? His further
objection, that the art of writing was at that time a rare accomplishment,
does not carry so much weight as he attached to
it, but the story is sufficiently refuted by what we know of
the character and customs of the Arabs in the sixth century
and afterwards. Is it conceivable that the proud sons of the
desert could have submitted a matter so nearly touching their
tribal honour, of which they were jealous above all things, to
external arbitration, or meekly acquiesced in the partial verdict
of a court sitting in the neighbourhood of Mecca, which would
certainly have shown scant consideration for competitors
belonging to distant clans?<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>However <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> is to be explained, the name is not
contemporary with the poems themselves. In all probability
they were so entitled by the person who first chose them

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#"><span><i>THE MU&#8216;ALLAQ&Aacute;T</i></span>103</a></span>

out of innumerable others and embodied them in a separate
collection. This is generally allowed to have been &#7716;amm&aacute;d
al-R&aacute;wiya, a famous rhapsodist who flourished in <span class="sidenote"> Origin of the
collection.</span>
the latter days of the Umayyad dynasty, and
died about 772 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, in the reign of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
Caliph Mahd&iacute;. What principle guided &#7716;amm&aacute;d in his choice
we do not know. N&ouml;ldeke conjectures that he was influenced
by the fact that all the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> are long poems&mdash;they are
sometimes called 'The Seven Long Poems' (<i>al-Sab&#8216; al-&#7788;iw&aacute;l</i>)&mdash;for
in &#7716;amm&aacute;d's time little of the ancient Arabian poetry
survived in a state even of relative completeness.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that no rendering of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>
can furnish European readers with a just idea of the originals,
a literal version least of all. They contain much <span class="sidenote">Difficulty of
translating
the Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t.</span>
that only a full commentary can make intelligible,
much that to modern taste is absolutely incongruous
with the poetic style. Their finest pictures of Bedouin
life and manners often appear uncouth or grotesque, because
without an intimate knowledge of the land and people it is
impossible for us to see what the poet intended to convey, or
to appreciate the truth and beauty of its expression; while the
artificial framework, the narrow range of subject as well as
treatment, and the frank realism of the whole strike us at
once. In the following pages I shall give some account of
the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> and their authors, and endeavour to bring out
the characteristic qualities of each poem by selecting suitable
passages for translation.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>The oldest and most famous of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> is that of
Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays, who was descended from the ancient kings of
Yemen. His grandfather was King &#7716;&aacute;rith of Kinda, the
antagonist of Mundhir III, King of &#7716;&iacute;ra, by whom he was

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_104" id="Page_104" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>104</a></span>

defeated and slain.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> On &#7716;&aacute;rith's death, the confederacy
which he had built up split asunder, and his sons divided among
themselves the different tribes of which it was <span class="sidenote">Imru&#8217;u
&#8217;l-Qays.</span>
composed. &#7716;ujr, the poet's father, ruled for some
time over the Ban&uacute; Asad in Central Arabia, but
finally they revolted and put him to death. "The duty of
avenging his murder fell upon Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays, who is represented
as the only capable prince of his family; and the
few historical data which we have regarding him relate to his
adventures while bent upon this vengeance."<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> They are told
at considerable length in the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, but need not
detain us here. Suffice it to say that his efforts to punish the
rebels, who were aided by Mundhir, the hereditary foe of his
house, met with little success. He then set out for Constantinople,
where he was favourably received by the Emperor
Justinian, who desired to see the power of Kinda re-established
as a thorn in the side of his Persian rivals. The emperor
appointed him Phylarch of Palestine, but on his way thither he
died at Angora (about 540 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). He is said to have perished,
like Nessus, from putting on a poisoned robe sent to him as a
gift by Justinian, with whose daughter he had an intrigue.
Hence he is sometimes called 'The Man of the Ulcers'
(<i>Dhu &#8217;l-Qur&uacute;&#7717;</i>).</p>

<p>Many fabulous traditions surround the romantic figure of
Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> According to one story, he was banished by
his father, who despised him for being a poet and was enraged
by the scandals to which his love adventures gave rise.
Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays left his home and wandered from tribe to tribe
with a company of outcasts like himself, leading a wild life,
which caused him to be known as 'The Vagabond Prince'
(<i>al-Malik al-&#7692;ill&iacute;l</i>). When the news of his father's death

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" href="#"><span><i>IMRU&#8217;U &#8217;L-QAYS</i></span>105</a></span>

reached him he cried, "My father wasted my youth, and now
that I am old he has laid upon me the burden of blood-revenge.
Wine to-day, business to-morrow!" Seven nights he continued
the carouse; then he swore not to eat flesh, nor drink
wine, nor use ointment, nor touch woman, nor wash his
head until his vengeance was accomplished. In the valley
of Tab&aacute;la, north of Najr&aacute;n, there was an idol called Dhu
&#8217;l-Khala&#7779;a much reverenced by the heathen Arabs. Imru&#8217;u
&#8217;l-Qays visited this oracle and consulted it in the ordinary way,
by drawing one of three arrows entitled 'the Commanding,'
'the Forbidding,' and 'the Waiting.' He drew the second,
whereupon he broke the arrows and dashed them on the face
of the idol, exclaiming with a gross imprecation, "If <i>thy</i>
father had been slain, thou would'st not have hindered me!"</p>

<p>Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays is almost universally reckoned the greatest
of the Pre-islamic poets. Mu&#7717;ammad described him as 'their
leader to Hell-fire,' while the Caliphs &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Al&iacute;,
<i>odium theologicum</i> notwithstanding, extolled his genius and originality.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>
Coming to the <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> itself, European critics have
vied with each other in praising its exquisite diction and
splendid images, the sweet flow of the verse, the charm and
variety of the painting, and, above all, the feeling by which it
is inspired of the joy and glory of youth. The passage translated
below is taken from the first half of the poem, in which
love is the prevailing theme:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>The noble qualities of his horse and its prowess in the

picture of a thunder-storm among the hills of Najd.</p>

<p class="tb">&#7788;arafa b. al-&#8216;Abd was a member of the great tribe of Bakr.
The particular clan to which he belonged was settled in
Ba&#7717;rayn on the Persian Gulf. He early developed <span class="sidenote"> &#7788;arafa.</span>
a talent for satire, which he exercised upon friend
and foe indifferently; and after he had squandered his
patrimony in dissolute pleasures, his family chased him away
as though he were 'a mangy camel.' At length a reconciliation
was effected. He promised to mend his ways, returned
to his people, and took part, it is said, in the War of
Bas&uacute;s. In a little while his means were dissipated once more
and he was reduced to tend his brother's herds. His <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i>
composed at this time won for him the favour of a rich kinsman
and restored him to temporary independence. On the
conclusion of peace between Bakr and Taghlib the youthful
poet turned his eyes in the direction of &#7716;&iacute;ra, where &#8216;Amr b.
Hind had lately succeeded to the throne (554 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). He was
well received by the king, who attached him, along with his
uncle, the poet Mutalammis, to the service of the heir-apparent.
But &#7788;arafa's bitter tongue was destined to cost him dear.
Fatigued and disgusted by the rigid ceremony of the court, he
improvised a satire in which he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Would that we had instead of &#8216;Amr</span>
<span class="i0">
A milch-ewe bleating round our tent!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shortly afterwards he happened to be seated at table opposite
the king's sister. Struck with her beauty, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>108</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Behold, she has come back to me,</span>
<span class="i0">
My fair gazelle whose ear-rings shine;</span>
<span class="i0">
Had not the king been sitting here,</span>
<span class="i0">
I would have pressed her lips to mine!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&#8216;Amr b. Hind was a man of violent and implacable temper.
&#7788;arafa's satire had already been reported to him, and this new
impertinence added fuel to his wrath. Sending for &#7788;arafa and
Mutalammis, he granted them leave to visit their homes, and
gave to each of them a sealed letter addressed to the governor
of Ba&#7717;rayn. When they had passed outside the city the
suspicions of Mutalammis were aroused. As neither he nor
his companion could read, he handed his own letter to a boy
of &#7716;&iacute;ra<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> and learned that it contained orders to bury him
alive. Thereupon he flung the treacherous missive into the
stream and implored &#7788;arafa to do likewise. &#7788;arafa refused
to break the royal seal. He continued his journey to Ba&#7717;rayn,
where he was thrown into prison and executed.</p>

<p>Thus perished miserably in the flower of his youth&mdash;according
to some accounts he was not yet twenty&mdash;the passionate
and eloquent &#7788;arafa. In his <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> he has drawn a
spirited portrait of himself. The most striking feature of
the poem, apart from a long and, to us who are not Bedouins,
painfully tedious description of the camel, is its insistence on
sensual enjoyment as the sole business of life:&mdash;</p>

<p>Keeping, as far as possible, the chronological order, we have
now to mention two <i>Mu&#8216;allaqas</i> which, though not directly
related to each other,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> are of the same period&mdash;the reign of
&#8216;Amr b. Hind, King of &#7716;&iacute;ra (554-568 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Moreover,
their strong mutual resemblance and their difference from the
other <i>Mu&#8216;allaqas</i>, especially from typical <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;das</i> like those of
&#8216;Antara and Lab&iacute;d, is a further reason for linking them
together. Their distinguishing mark is the abnormal space
devoted to the main subject, which leaves little room for
the subsidiary motives.</p>

<p>&#8216;Amr b. Kulth&uacute;m belonged to the tribe of Taghlib. His
mother was Layl&aacute;, a daughter of the famous poet and warrior
Muhalhil. That she was a woman of heroic <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Amr b.
Kulth&uacute;m.</span>
mould appears from the following anecdote, which
records a deed of prompt vengeance on the part
of &#8216;Amr that gave rise to the proverb, "Bolder in onset than
&#8216;Amr b. Kulth&uacute;m"<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One day &#8216;Amr. b. Hind, the King of &#7716;&iacute;ra, said to his boon-companions,
"Do ye know any Arab whose mother would disdain to
serve mine?" They answered, "Yes, the mother of &#8216;Amr b.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_110" id="Page_110" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>110</a></span>

Kulth&uacute;m." "Why so?" asked the king. "Because," said they, "her
father is Muhalhil b. Rab&iacute;&#8216;a and her uncle is Kulayb b. W&aacute;&#8217;il, the
most puissant of the Arabs, and her husband is <span class="sidenote">How &#8217;Amr
avenged an
insult to his
mother.</span>
Kulth&uacute;m b. M&aacute;lik, the knightliest, and her son is &#8216;Amr,
the chieftain of his tribe." Then the king sent to &#8216;Amr
b. Kulth&uacute;m, inviting him to pay a visit to himself, and
asking him to bring his mother, Layl&aacute;, to visit his own mother,
Hind. So &#8216;Amr came to &#7716;&iacute;ra with some men of Taghlib, and
Layl&aacute; came attended by a number of their women; and while
the king entertained &#8216;Amr and his friends in a pavilion which he
had caused to be erected between &#7716;&iacute;ra and the Euphrates, Layl&aacute;
found quarters with Hind in a tent adjoining. Now, the king had
ordered his mother, as soon as he should call for dessert, to dismiss
the servants, and cause Layl&aacute; to wait upon her. At the pre-arranged
signal she desired to be left alone with her guest, and said, "O Layl&aacute;,
hand me that dish." Layl&aacute; answered, "Let those who want anything
rise up and serve themselves." Hind repeated her demand, and
would take no denial. "O shame!" cried Layl&aacute;. "Help! Taghlib,
help!" When &#8216;Amr heard his mother's cry the blood flew to his
cheeks. He seized a sword hanging on the wall of the pavilion&mdash;the
only weapon there&mdash;and with a single blow smote the king
dead.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p></div>

<p>&#8216;Amr's <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> is the work of a man who united in
himself the ideal qualities of manhood as these were understood
by a race which has never failed to value, even too
highly, the display of self-reliant action and decisive energy.
And if in &#8216;Amr's poem these virtues are displayed with an
exaggerated boastfulness which offends our sense of decency
and proper reserve, it would be a grave error to conclude that
all this sound and fury signifies nothing. The Bedouin poet
deems it his bounden duty to glorify to the utmost himself, his
family, and his tribe; the Bedouin warrior is never tired of
proclaiming his unshakable valour and recounting his brilliant
feats of arms: he hurls menaces and vaunts in the same breath,
but it does not follow that he is a <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>. &#8216;Amr
certainly was not: his <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> leaves a vivid impression of
conscious and exultant strength. The first eight verses seem

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#"><span><i>&#8216;AMR IBN KULTH&Uacute;M</i></span>111</a></span>

to have been added to the poem at a very early date, for out of
them arose the legend that &#8216;Amr drank himself to death with
unmixed wine. It is likely that they were included in the
original collection of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>, and they are worth
translating for their own sake:&mdash;-</p>

<p>Less interesting is the <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> of &#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#7716;illiza of
Bakr. Its inclusion among the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> is probably due, as

b. Kulth&uacute;m, which immortalised their great rivals, the Ban&uacute;
Taghlib. &#7716;&aacute;rith's poem, however, has some historical importance,
as it throws light on feuds in Northern Arabia
connected with the antagonism of the Roman and Persian
Empires. Its purpose is to complain of unjust accusations

any stretch of imagination. His mother was a black slave,
and he must often have been taunted with his African blood,
which showed itself in a fiery courage that gained the respect
of the pure-bred but generally less valorous Arabs. &#8216;Antara
loved his cousin &#8216;Abla, and following the Arabian custom by
which cousins have the first right to a girl's hand, he asked
her in marriage. His suit was vain&mdash;the son of a slave mother
being regarded as a slave unless acknowledged by his father&mdash;until
on one occasion, while the &#8216;Absites were hotly engaged
with some raiders who had driven off their camels, &#8216;Antara
refused to join in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, saying, "A slave does not understand
how to fight; his work is to milk the camels and bind
their udders." "Charge!" cried his father, "thou art free."

<p>his contemptuous references to 'jabbering barbarians,' and to

<p>While &#8216;Antara's poem belongs to the final stages of the
War of D&aacute;&#7717;is, the <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i> of his contemporary, Zuhayr b.
Ab&iacute; Sulm&aacute;, of the tribe of Muzayna, celebrates <span class="sidenote"> Zuhayr.</span>
an act of private munificence which brought
about the conclusion of peace. By the self-sacrificing intervention
of two chiefs of Dhuby&aacute;n, Harim b. Sin&aacute;n and
&#7716;&aacute;rith b. &#8216;Awf, the whole sum of blood-money to which
the &#8216;Absites were entitled on account of the greater number
of those who had fallen on their side, was paid over to them.
Such an example of generous and disinterested patriotism&mdash;for
Harim and &#7716;&aacute;rith had shed no blood themselves&mdash;was a fit
subject for one of whom it was said that he never praised men
but as they deserved:&mdash;</p>

<p>The ripe sententious wisdom and moral earnestness of
Zuhayr's poetry are in keeping with what has been said

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#"><span><i>ZUHAYR</i></span>119</a></span>

above concerning his religious ideas and, from another point
of view, with the tradition that he used to compose a <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>
in four months, correct it for four months, submit it to the
poets of his acquaintance during a like period, and not
make it public until a year had expired.</p>

<p>Of his life there is little to tell. Probably he died before
Islam, though it is related that when he was a centenarian he
met the Prophet, who cried out on seeing him, "O God,
preserve me from his demon!"<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> The poetical gifts which
he inherited from his uncle Bash&aacute;ma he bequeathed to his
son Ka&#8216;b, author of the famous ode, <i>B&aacute;nat Su&#8216;&aacute;d</i>.</p>

<p>Lab&iacute;d b. Rab&iacute;&#8216;a, of the Ban&uacute; &#8216;&Aacute;mir b. &#7778;a&#8216;&#7779;a&#8216;a, was born in the
latter half of the sixth century, and is said to have died soon
after Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's accession to the Caliphate, which <span class="sidenote"> Lab&iacute;d.</span>
took place in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 661. He is thus the youngest
of the Seven Poets. On accepting Islam he abjured poetry,
saying, "God has given me the Koran in exchange for it."
Like Zuhayr, he had, even in his heathen days, a strong vein
of religious feeling, as is shown by many passages in his
D&iacute;w&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Lab&iacute;d was a true Bedouin, and his <i>Mu&#8216;allaqa</i>, with its
charmingly fresh pictures of desert life and scenery, must be
considered one of the finest examples of the Pre-islamic <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>
that have come down to us. The poet owes something to his
predecessors, but the greater part seems to be drawn from his
own observation. He begins in the conventional manner by
describing the almost unrecognisable vestiges of the camping-ground
of the clan to which his mistress belonged:&mdash;</p>

<p>After lamenting the departure of his beloved the poet bids
himself think no more about her: he will ride swiftly away
from the spot. Naturally, he must praise his camel, and he
introduces by way of comparison two wonderful pictures of
animal life. In the former the onager is described racing at
full speed over the backs of the hills when thirst and hunger
drive him with his mate far from the barren solitudes into
which they usually retire. The second paints a wild-cow,
whose young calf has been devoured by wolves, sleeping
among the sand-dunes through a night of incessant rain. At
daybreak "her feet glide over the firm wet soil." For a
whole week she runs to and fro, anxiously seeking her calf,
when suddenly she hears the sound of hunters approaching and
makes off in alarm. Being unable to get within bowshot, the
hunters loose their dogs, but she turns desperately upon them,
wounding one with her needle-like horn and killing another.</p>

<p>Then, once more addressing his beloved, the poet speaks
complacently of his share in the feasting and revelling, on
which a noble Arab plumes himself hardly less than on his
bravery:&mdash;</p>

<p>Continuing, he boasts of dangerous service as a spy in the
enemy's country, when he watched all day on the top of
a steep crag; of his fearless demeanour and dignified assertion
of his rights in an assembly at &#7716;&iacute;ra, to which he came as
a delegate, and of his liberality to the poor. The closing
verses are devoted, in accordance with custom, to matters
of immediate interest and to a panegyric on the virtues of the
poet's kin.</p>

<p class="tb">Besides the authors of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> three poets may be
mentioned, of whom the two first-named are universally
acknowledged to rank with the greatest that Arabia has
produced&mdash;N&aacute;bigha, A&#8216;sh&aacute;, and &#8216;Alqama.</p>

<p>N&aacute;bigha<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>&mdash;his proper name is Ziy&aacute;d b. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, of the
tribe Dhuby&aacute;n&mdash;lived at the courts of Ghass&aacute;n and &#7716;&iacute;ra <span class="sidenote"> N&aacute;bigha of
Dhuby&aacute;n.</span>
during the latter half of the century before
Islam. His chief patron was King Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n b.
Mundhir Ab&uacute; Q&aacute;b&uacute;s of &#7716;&iacute;ra. For many years
he basked in the sunshine of royal favour, enjoying every
privilege that Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n bestowed on his most intimate friends.
The occasion of their falling out is differently related.
According to one story, the poet described the charms of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>122</a></span>

Queen Mutajarrida, which Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n had asked him to
celebrate, with such charm and liveliness as to excite her
husband's suspicion; but it is said&mdash;and N&aacute;bigha's own words
make it probable&mdash;that his enemies denounced him as the
author of a scurrilous satire against Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n which had been
forged by themselves. At any rate he had no choice but to
quit &#7716;&iacute;ra with all speed, and ere long we find him in Ghass&aacute;n,
welcomed and honoured, as the panegyrist of King &#8216;Amr b.
&#7716;&aacute;rith and the noble house of Jafna. But his heart was in
&#7716;&iacute;ra still. Deeply wounded by the calumnies of which he
was the victim, he never ceased to affirm his innocence and to
lament the misery of exile. The following poem, which he
addressed to Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, is at once a justification and an appeal
for mercy<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record that N&aacute;bigha was finally reconciled
to the prince whom he loved, and that &#7716;&iacute;ra again became his
home. The date of his death is unknown, but it certainly
took place before Islam was promulgated. Had the opportunity
been granted to him he might have died a Moslem: he
calls himself 'a religious man' (<i>dh&uacute; ummat<sup>in</sup></i>),<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> and although
the tradition that he was actually a Christian lacks authority,
his long residence in Syria and &#8216;Ir&aacute;q must have made him
acquainted with the externals of Christianity and with some,
at least, of its leading ideas.</p>

<p>The grave and earnest tone characteristic of N&aacute;bigha's poetry
seldom prevails in that of his younger contemporary, Maym&uacute;n <span class="sidenote">A&#8216;sh&aacute;.</span>
b. Qays, who is generally known by his surname,
al-A&#8216;sh&aacute;&mdash;that is, 'the man of weak sight.' A
professional troubadour, he roamed from one end of Arabia to
the other, harp in hand, singing the praises of those who
rewarded him; and such was his fame as a satirist that few
ventured to withhold the bounty which he asked. By common
consent he stands in the very first rank of Arabian poets.
Abu &#8217;l-Faraj, the author of the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, declares him
to be superior to all the rest, adding, however, "this opinion is
not held unanimously as regards A&#8216;sh&aacute; or any other." His

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>124</a></span>

wandering life brought him into contact with every kind of
culture then existing in Arabia. Although he was not an
avowed Christian, his poetry shows to what an extent he was
influenced by the Bishops of Najr&aacute;n, with whom he was
intimately connected, and by the Christian merchants of
&#7716;&iacute;ra who sold him their wine. He did not rise above
the pagan level of morality.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is related that he set out to visit Mu&#7717;ammad for the purpose
of reciting to him an ode which he had composed in his honour.
When the Quraysh heard of this, they feared lest their adversary's
reputation should be increased by the panegyric of a bard so famous
and popular. Accordingly, they intercepted him on his way, and
asked whither he was bound. "To your kinsman," said he, "that I
may accept Islam." "He will forbid and make unlawful to thee
certain practices of which thou art fond." "What are these?" said
A&#8216;sh&aacute;. "Fornication," said Ab&uacute; Sufy&aacute;n, "I have not abandoned it,"
he replied, "but it has abandoned me. What else?" "Gambling."
"Perhaps I shall obtain from him something to compensate me for
the loss of gambling. What else?" "Usury." "I have never
borrowed nor lent. What else?" "Wine." "Oh, in that case I will
drink the water I have left stored at al-Mihr&aacute;s." Seeing that A&#8216;sh&aacute;
was not to be deterred, Ab&uacute; Sufy&aacute;n offered him a hundred camels
on condition that he should return to his home in Yam&aacute;ma
and await the issue of the struggle between Mu&#7717;ammad and
the Quraysh. "I agree," said A&#8216;sh&aacute;. "O ye Quraysh," cried Ab&uacute;
Sufy&aacute;n, "this is A&#8216;sh&aacute;, and by God, if he becomes a follower of
Mu&#7717;ammad, he will inflame the Arabs against you by his poetry.
Collect, therefore, a hundred camels for him."<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p></div>

<p>A&#8216;sh&aacute; excels in the description of wine and wine-parties.
One who visited Manf&uacute;&#7717;a in Yam&aacute;ma, where the poet was
buried, relates that revellers used to meet at his grave and pour
out beside it the last drops that remained in their cups. As an
example of his style in this <i>genre</i> I translate a few lines from
the most celebrated of his poems, which is included by some
critics among the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Very little is known of the life of &#8216;Alqama b. &#8216;Abada, who

<p>In view of these slighting verses it is proper to observe that
the poetry of Arabian women of the Pre-islamic period is distinctly <span class="sidenote"> Elegiac poetry.</span>
masculine in character. Their songs are
seldom of Love, but often of Death. Elegy
(<i>rith&aacute;</i> or <i>marthiya</i>) was regarded as their special province.

<p>"As a rule the Arabian dirge is very simple. The poetess
begins with a description of her grief, of the tears that she
cannot quench, and then she shows how worthy to be deeply
mourned was he whom death has taken away. He is described
as a pattern of the two principal Arabian virtues, bravery and
liberality, and the question is anxiously asked, 'Who will now
make high resolves, overthrow the enemy, and in time of want
feed the poor and entertain the stranger?' If the hero of the
dirge died a violent death we find in addition a burning lust of
revenge, a thirst for the slayer's blood, expressed with an
intensity of feeling of which only women are capable."<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

Islam. By far the most famous of her elegies
are those in which she bewailed her valiant brothers, Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya
and &#7778;akhr, both of whom were struck down by sword or
spear. It is impossible to translate the poignant and vivid
emotion, the energy of passion and noble simplicity of style

shorter pieces or fragments, which were arranged under different
heads according to their subject-matter.</p>

<p>Among <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;ns</i> mention may be made of <i>The D&iacute;w&aacute;ns of

to these two odes by N&aacute;bigha and A&#8216;sh&aacute; are
sometimes added. The compiler was probably
&#7716;amm&aacute;d al-R&aacute;wiya, a famous rhapsodist of Persian descent,
who flourished under the Umayyads and died in the second
half of the eighth century of our era. As the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> have
been discussed above, we may pass on directly to a much
larger, though less celebrated, collection dating from the same
period, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The <i>Mufa&#7693;&#7693;aliyy&aacute;t</i>,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> by which title it is generally known

for on arriving at Hamadh&aacute;n (Ecbatana) the winter had set in,
and as the cold was excessively severe in that country, the
snow blocked up the road and obliged him to stop and await
the thaw. During his stay he resided with one of the most
eminent men of the place, who possessed a library in which
were some collections of poems composed by the Arabs of the
desert and other authors. Having then sufficient leisure, he
perused those works and selected from them the passages out of
which he formed his <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> The work is divided into ten

<p>The contents of the <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i> include short poems complete
in themselves as well as passages extracted from longer poems;
of the poets represented, some of whom belong to the Pre-islamic
and others to the early Islamic period, comparatively
few are celebrated, while many are anonymous or only known
by the verses attached to their names. If the high level of
excellence attained by these obscure singers shows, on the one
hand, that a natural genius for poetry was widely diffused and
that the art was successfully cultivated among all ranks of
Arabian society, we must not forget how much is due to the
fine taste of Ab&uacute; Tamm&aacute;m, who, as the commentator
Tibr&iacute;z&iacute; has remarked, "is a better poet in his <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i> than
in his poetry."</p>

<p>4. The <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i> of Bu&#7717;tur&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;897 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), a younger contemporary
<span class="sidenote">4. The <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i>
of Bu&#7717;tur&iacute;.</span>
of Ab&uacute; Tamm&aacute;m, is inferior to its model.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> However
convenient from a practical standpoint, the
division into a great number of sections, each
illustrating a narrowly defined topic, seriously
impairs the artistic value of the work; moreover, Bu&#7717;tur&iacute;
seems to have had a less catholic appreciation of the beauties
of poetry&mdash;he admired, it is said, only what was in harmony
with his own style and ideas.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Jamharatu Ash&#8216;&aacute;ri &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab</i>, a collection of forty-nine

1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> by Ab&uacute; Zayd Mu&#7717;ammad al-Qurash&iacute;,
of whom we find no mention elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#"><span><i>ORAL TRADITION</i></span>131</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;ns</i> and anthologies, numerous Pre-islamic
<span class="sidenote"> Prose sources.</span>
verses are cited in biographical, philological, and other
works, <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i> by Abu &#8217;l-Faraj
of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;967<span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>), the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Am&aacute;l&iacute;</i> by
Ab&uacute; &#8216;Al&iacute; al-Q&aacute;l&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;967<span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>), the <i>K&aacute;mil</i> of Mubarrad (&#8224;&nbsp;898
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and the <i>Khiz&aacute;natu &#8217;l-Adab</i> of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;dir of Baghd&aacute;d
(&#8224;&nbsp;1682 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p class="tb">We have seen that the oldest existing poems date from the
beginning of the sixth century of our era, whereas the art of
writing did not come into general use among the <span class="sidenote"> The tradition
of Pre-islamic
poetry.</span>
Arabs until some two hundred years afterwards.
Pre-islamic poetry, therefore, was preserved by
oral tradition alone, and the question arises, How was this
possible? What guarantee have we that songs living on
men's lips for so long a period have retained their original
form, even approximately? No doubt many verses, <i>e.g.</i>, those
which glorified the poet's tribe or satirised their enemies,
were constantly being recited by his kin, and in this way
short occasional poems or fragments of longer ones might be
perpetuated. Of whole <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;das</i> like the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>, however,
none or very few would have reached us if their survival
had depended solely on their popularity. What actually saved
them in the first place was an institution resembling that of
the Rhapsodists in Greece. Every professed poet<span class="sidenote"> The R&aacute;w&iacute;s.</span>
had his <i>R&aacute;w&iacute;</i> (reciter), who accompanied him
everywhere, committed his poems to memory, and handed
them down, as well as the circumstances connected with
them, to others. The characters of poet and <i>r&aacute;w&iacute;</i> were
often combined; thus Zuhayr was the <i>r&aacute;w&iacute;</i> of his stepfather,
Aws b. &#7716;ajar, while his own <i>r&aacute;w&iacute;</i> was al-&#7716;u&#7789;ay&#8217;a.
If the tradition of poetry was at first a labour of love, it
afterwards became a lucrative business, and the <i>R&aacute;w&iacute;s</i>,
instead of being attached to individual poets, began to form
an independent class, carrying in their memories a prodigious

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>132</a></span>

stock of ancient verse and miscellaneous learning. It is
related, for example, that &#7716;amm&aacute;d once said to the Caliph
Wal&iacute;d b. Yaz&iacute;d: "I can recite to you, for each letter of
the alphabet, one hundred long poems rhyming in that
letter, without taking into count the short pieces, and all
that composed exclusively by poets who lived before the
promulgation of Islamism." He commenced and continued
until the Caliph, having grown fatigued, withdrew, after
leaving a person in his place to verify the assertion and
hear him to the last. In that sitting he recited two
thousand nine hundred <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;das</i> by poets who flourished
before Mu&#7717;ammad. Wal&iacute;d, on being informed of the fact,
ordered him a present of one hundred thousand dirhems.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>
Thus, towards the end of the first century after the Hijra,
<i>i.e.</i>, about 700<span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>, when the custom of <i>writing</i> poetry
began, there was much of Pre-islamic origin still in circulation,
although it is probable that far more had already been
irretrievably lost. Numbers of <i>R&aacute;w&iacute;s</i> perished in the wars,
or passed away in the course of nature, without leaving any
one to continue their tradition. New times had brought
new interests and other ways of life. The great majority
of Moslems had no sympathy whatever with the ancient
poetry, which represented in their eyes the unregenerate
spirit of heathendom. They wanted nothing beyond the
Koran and the &#7716;ad&iacute;th. But for reasons which will be
stated in another chapter the language of the Koran and
the &#7716;ad&iacute;th was rapidly becoming obsolete as a spoken
idiom outside of the Arabian peninsula: the 'perspicuous
Arabic' on which Mu&#7717;ammad prided himself had ceased
to be fully intelligible to the Moslems settled in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q
and Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, in Syria, and in Egypt. It was essential
that the Sacred Text should be explained, and this
necessity gave birth to the sciences of Grammar and Lexicography.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_133" id="Page_133" href="#"><span><i>THE R&Aacute;W&Iacute;S OR RHAPSODISTS</i></span>133</a></span>

The Philologists, or, as they have been aptly
designated, the Humanists of Ba&#7779;ra and K&uacute;fa, where these
studies were prosecuted with peculiar zeal, naturally
found their best material in the Pre-islamic <span class="sidenote"> The Humanists.</span>
poems&mdash;a well of Arabic undefiled. At first the ancient
poetry merely formed a basis for philological research, but
in process of time a literary enthusiasm was awakened. The
surviving <i>R&aacute;w&iacute;s</i> were eagerly sought out and induced to
yield up their stores, the compositions of famous poets were
collected, arranged, and committed to writing, and as the
demand increased, so did the supply.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p class="tb">In these circumstances a certain amount of error was inevitable.
Apart from unconscious failings of memory, there <span class="sidenote">Corrupt
tradition of the
old poetry.</span>
can be no doubt that in many cases the <i>R&aacute;w&iacute;s</i>
acted with intent to deceive. The temptation
to father their own verses, or centos which
they pieced together from sources known only to themselves,
upon some poet of antiquity was all the stronger
because they ran little risk of detection. In knowledge of
poetry and in poetical talent they were generally far more
than a match for the philologists, who seldom possessed any
critical ability, but readily took whatever came to hand. The
stories which are told of &#7716;amm&aacute;d al-R&aacute;wiya, <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;amm&aacute;d
al-R&aacute;wiya.</span>
clearly show how unscrupulous he was in his
methods, though we have reason to suppose that
he was not a typical example of his class. His contemporary,
Mufa&#7693;&#7693;al al-&#7692;abb&iacute;, is reported to have said that the corruption
which poetry suffered through &#7716;amm&aacute;d could never be
repaired, "for," he added, "&#7716;amm&aacute;d is a man skilled in the
language and poesy of the Arabs and in the styles and ideas of
the poets, and he is always making verses in imitation of some

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>134</a></span>

one and introducing them into genuine compositions by the
same author, so that the copy passes everywhere for part of the
original, and cannot be distinguished from it except by critical
scholars&mdash;and where are such to be found?"<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> This art
of forgery was brought to perfection by Khalaf <span class="sidenote"> Khalaf
al-A&#7717;mar.</span>
al-A&#7717;mar (&#8224;&nbsp;about 800 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), who learned it in
the school of &#7716;amm&aacute;d. If he really composed
the famous <i>L&aacute;miyya</i> ascribed to Shanfar&aacute;, his own poetical
endowments must have been of the highest order. In his
old age he repented and confessed that he was the author
of several poems which the scholars of Ba&#7779;ra and K&uacute;fa had
accepted as genuine, but they laughed him to scorn, saying,
"What you said then seems to us more trustworthy than
your present assertion."</p>

<p>Besides the corruptions due to the <i>R&aacute;w&iacute;s</i>, others have been
accumulated by the philologists themselves. As the Koran
and the &#7716;ad&iacute;th were, of course, spoken and <span class="sidenote"> Other causes of
corruption.</span>
afterwards written in the dialect of Quraysh, to
whom Mu&#7717;ammad belonged, this dialect was
regarded as the classical standard;<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> consequently the variations
therefrom which occurred in the ancient poems were,
for the most part, 'emended' and harmonised with it.
Many changes were made under the influence of Islam,
<i>e.g.</i>, 'Allah' was probably often substituted for the pagan
goddess 'al-L&aacute;t.' Moreover, the structure of the <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>,
its disconnectedness and want of logical cohesion, favoured
the omission and transposition of whole passages or single
verses. All these modes of depravation might be illustrated
in detail, but from what has been said the reader
can judge for himself how far the poems, as they now
stand, are likely to have retained the form in which they
were first uttered to the wild Arabs of the Pre-islamic Age.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#"><span><i>INFLUENCE OF RELIGION</i></span>135</a></span></p>

<p>Religion had so little influence on the lives of the Pre-islamic
Arabs that we cannot expect to find much trace <span class="sidenote"> Religion.</span>
of it in their poetry. They believed vaguely
in a supreme God, Allah, and more definitely
in his three daughters&mdash;al-L&aacute;t, Man&aacute;t, and al-&#8216;Uzz&aacute;&mdash;who
were venerated all over Arabia and whose intercession was
graciously accepted by Allah. There were also numerous
idols enjoying high favour while they continued to bring
good luck to their worshippers. Of real piety the ordinary
Bedouin knew nothing. He felt no call to pray to his
gods, although he often found them convenient to swear
by. He might invoke Allah in the hour of need, as a
drowning man will clutch at a straw; but his faith in
superstitious ceremonies was stronger. He did not take his
religion too seriously. Its practical advantages he was quick
to appreciate. Not to mention baser pleasures, it gave him
rest and security during the four sacred months, in which
war was forbidden, while the institution of the Meccan
Pilgrimage enabled him to take part in a national f&ecirc;te.
<span class="sidenote">The Fair of
&#8216;Uk&aacute;&#7827;.</span>Commerce went hand in hand with religion.
Great fairs were held, the most famous being
that of &#8216;Uk&aacute;&#7827;, which lasted for twenty days.
These fairs were in some sort the centre of old Arabian
social, political, and literary life. It was the only occasion
on which free and fearless intercourse was possible between
the members of different clans.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>Plenty of excitement was provided by poetical and oratorical
displays&mdash;not by athletic sports, as in ancient Greece and
modern England. Here rival poets declaimed their verses
and submitted them to the judgment of an acknowledged
master. Nowhere else had rising talents such an opportunity
of gaining wide reputation: what &#8216;Uk&aacute;&#7827; said to-day
all Arabia would repeat to-morrow. At &#8216;Uk&aacute;&#7827;, we are told,
the youthful Mu&#7717;ammad listened, as though spellbound, to

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>136</a></span>

the persuasive eloquence of Quss b. S&aacute;&#8216;ida, Bishop of Najr&aacute;n;
and he may have contrasted the discourse of the Christian
preacher with the brilliant odes chanted by heathen bards.</p>

<p class="tb">The Bedouin view of life was thoroughly hedonistic. Love,
wine, gambling, hunting, the pleasures of song and romance,
the brief, pointed, and elegant expression of wit and wisdom&mdash;these
things he knew to be good. Beyond them he saw only
the grave.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to suppose that these men always,
or even generally, passed their lives in the aimless pursuit
of pleasure. Some goal they had&mdash;earthly, no doubt&mdash;such as
the accumulation of wealth or the winning of glory or the fulfilment
of blood-revenge. "<i>God forbid</i>" says one, "<i>that I
should die while a grievous longing, as it were a mountain,
weighs on my breast!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> A deeper chord is touched by
Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays: "<i>If I strove for a bare livelihood, scanty
means would suffice me and I would seek no more. But I
strive for lasting renown, and 'tis men like me that sometimes
attain lasting renown. Never, while life endures, does

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_137" id="Page_137" href="#"><span><i>JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY</i></span>137</a></span></p>

<p>These are noble sentiments nobly expressed. Yet one hears
the sigh of weariness, as if the speaker were struggling against
the conviction that his cause is already lost, and would welcome
the final stroke of destiny. It was a time of wild uproar and
confusion. Tribal and family feuds filled the land, as Zuhayr
says, with evil fumes. No wonder that earnest and thoughtful
minds asked themselves&mdash;What worth has our life, what meaning?
Whither does it lead? Such questions paganism could
not answer, but Arabia in the century before Mu&#7717;ammad was
not wholly abandoned to paganism. Jewish colonists had long
been settled in the &#7716;ij&aacute;z. Probably the earliest settlements
date from the conquest of Palestine by Titus or Hadrian. In
their new home the refugees, through contact <span class="sidenote"> Judaism and
Christianity in
Arabia.</span>
with a people nearly akin to themselves, became
fully Arabicised, as the few extant specimens of
their poetry bear witness. They remained Jews, however,
not only in their cultivation of trade and various industries, but
also in the most vital particular&mdash;their religion. This, and
the fact that they lived in isolated communities among the
surrounding population, marked them out as the salt of the
desert. In the &#7716;ij&aacute;z their spiritual predominance was not
seriously challenged. It was otherwise in Yemen. We may
leave out of account the legend according to which Judaism
was introduced into that country from the &#7716;ij&aacute;z by the
Tubba&#8216; As&#8216;ad K&aacute;mil. What is certain is that towards the
beginning of the sixth century it was firmly planted there
side by side with Christianity, and that in the person of
the &#7716;imyarite monarch Dh&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, who adopted the Jewish
faith, it won a short-lived but sanguinary triumph over its
rival. But in Yemen, except among the highlanders of
Najr&aacute;n, Christianity does not appear to have flourished as it
did in the extreme north and north-east, where the Roman and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_138" id="Page_138" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>138</a></span>

Persian frontiers were guarded by the Arab levies of Ghass&aacute;n
and &#7716;&iacute;ra. We have seen that the latter city contained a large
Christian population who were called distinctively <span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Ib&aacute;d
of &#7716;&iacute;ra.</span>
&#8216;Ib&aacute;d, <i>i.e.</i>, Servants (of God). Through them
the Aramaic culture of Babylonia was transmitted
to all parts of the peninsula. They had learned the art of
writing long before it was generally practised in Arabia, as is
shown by the story of &#7788;arafa and Mutalammis, and they produced
the oldest <i>written</i> poetry in the Arabic language&mdash;a
poetry very different in character from that which forms
the main subject of this chapter. Unfortunately the bulk
of it has perished, since the rhapsodists, to whom we owe
the preservation of so much Pre-islamic verse, were devoted to
the traditional models and would not burden their memories
with anything new-fashioned. The most famous of the &#8216;Ib&aacute;d&iacute;
poets is &#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Zayd, whose adventurous career as a politician
has been sketched above. He is not reckoned by Mu&#7717;ammadan
critics among the <i>Fu&#7717;&uacute;l</i> or poets of the first rank, because
he was a townsman (<i>qaraw&iacute;</i>). In this connection <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Ad&iacute; b. Zayd.</span>
the following anecdote is instructive. The
poet al-&#8216;Ajj&aacute;j (&#8224;&nbsp;about 709 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) said of his contemporaries
al-&#7788;irimm&aacute;&#7717; and al-Kumayt: "They used to ask me concerning
rare expressions in the language of poetry, and I informed
them, but afterwards I found the same expressions wrongly
applied in their poems, the reason being that they were
townsmen who described what they had not seen and misapplied
it, whereas I who am a Bedouin describe what I
have seen and apply it properly."<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> &#8216;Ad&iacute; is chiefly remembered
for his wine-songs. Oriental Christianity has always been
associated with the drinking and selling of wine. Christian
ideas were carried into the heart of Arabia by &#8216;Ib&aacute;d&iacute; wine
merchants, who are said to have taught their religion to the
celebrated A&#8216;sh&aacute;. &#8216;Ad&iacute; drank and was merry like the rest, but

<p>It is said that the recitation of these verses induced Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n
al-Akbar, one of the mythical pagan kings of &#7716;&iacute;ra, to accept
Christianity and become an anchorite. Although the story
involves an absurd anachronism, it is <i>ben trovato</i> in so far as it
records the impression which the graver sort of Christian
poetry was likely to make on heathen minds.</p>

<p>The courts of &#7716;&iacute;ra and Ghass&aacute;n were well known to the
wandering minstrels of the time before Mu&#7717;ammad, who
flocked thither in eager search of patronage and remuneration.
We may be sure that men like N&aacute;bigha, Lab&iacute;d, and A&#8216;sh&aacute; did
not remain unaffected by the culture around them, even if it
seldom entered very deeply into their lives. That considerable
traces of religious feeling are to be found in Pre-islamic poetry
admits of no denial, but the passages in question were formerly
explained as due to interpolation. This view no longer prevails.
Thanks mainly to the arguments of Von <span class="sidenote"> Pre-Islamic
poetry not exclusively
pagan
in sentiment.</span>
Kremer, Sir Charles Lyall, and Wellhausen, it
has come to be recognised (1) that in many cases
the above-mentioned religious feeling is not
Islamic in tone; (2) that the passages in which it occurs

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_140" id="Page_140" href="#"><span><i>PRE-ISLAMIC POETRY</i></span>140</a></span>

are not of Islamic origin; and (3) that it is the natural and
necessary result of the widely spread, though on the whole
superficial, influence of Judaism, and especially of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>
It shows itself not only in frequent allusions, <i>e.g.</i>, to the monk
in his solitary cell, whose lamp serves to light belated travellers
on their way, and in more significant references, such as that
of Zuhayr already quoted, to the Heavenly Book in which evil
actions are enscrolled for the Day of Reckoning, but also in
the tendency to moralise, to look within, to meditate on death,
and to value the life of the individual rather than the continued
existence of the family. These things are not characteristic
of old Arabian poetry, but the fact that they do appear at
times is quite in accord with the other facts which have been
stated, and justifies the conclusion that during the sixth century
religion and culture were imperceptibly extending their sphere
of influence in Arabia, leavening the pagan masses, and
gradually preparing the way for Islam.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>

<h5>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</h5>

<p>With the appearance of Mu&#7717;ammad the almost impenetrable
veil thrown over the preceding age is suddenly lifted and we
find ourselves on the solid ground of historical tradition. In
order that the reasons for this change may be understood, it is
necessary to give some account of the principal sources from
which our knowledge of the Prophet's life and teaching is
derived.</p>

<p>There is first, of course, the Koran,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> consisting "exclusively
<span class="sidenote">Sources of information:
I. The
Koran.</span>
of the revelations or commands which Mu&#7717;ammad professed,
from time to time, to receive through Gabriel as
a message direct from God; and which, under an
alleged Divine direction, he delivered to those
about him. At the time of pretended inspiration, or shortly
after, each passage was recited by Mu&#7717;ammad before the
Companions or followers who happened to be present, and was
generally committed to writing by some one amongst them
upon palm-leaves, leather, stones, or such other rude material
as conveniently came to hand. These Divine messages continued
throughout the three-and-twenty years of his prophetical
life, so that the last portion did not appear till the year of his
death. The canon was then closed; but the contents were

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_142" id="Page_142" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>142</a></span>

never, during the Prophet's lifetime, systematically arranged,
or even collected together."<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> They were preserved, however,
in fragmentary copies and, especially, by oral <span class="sidenote"> How it was
preserved.</span>
recitation until the sanguinary wars which followed
Mu&#7717;ammad's death had greatly diminished
the number of those who could repeat them by heart.
Accordingly, after the battle of Yam&aacute;ma (633 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) &#8216;Umar
b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b came to Ab&uacute; Bakr, who was then Caliph, and
said: "I fear that slaughter may wax hot among the
Reciters on other battle-fields, and that much of the Koran
may be lost; so in my opinion it should be collected without
delay." Ab&uacute; Bakr agreed, and entrusted the task to Zayd
b. Th&aacute;bit, one of the Prophet's amanuenses, who collected
the fragments with great difficulty "from bits of parchment,
thin white stones, leafless palm-branches, and the bosoms of
men." The manuscript thus compiled was deposited with
Ab&uacute; Bakr during the remainder of his life, then with &#8216;Umar,
on whose death it passed to his daughter &#7716;af&#7779;a. Afterwards,
in the Caliphate of &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n, &#7716;udhayfa b. al-Yam&aacute;n, observing
that the Koran as read in Syria was seriously at variance
with the text current in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, warned the Caliph to interfere,
lest the Sacred Book of the Moslems should become a subject
of dispute, like the Jewish and Christian scriptures. In the
year 651 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n ordered Zayd b. Th&aacute;bit to prepare a
Revised Version with the assistance of three Qurayshites,
saying to the latter, "If ye differ from Zayd regarding any
word of the Koran, write it in the dialect of Quraysh; for it
was revealed in their dialect."<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> This has ever since remained
the final and standard recension of the Koran. "Transcripts
were multiplied and forwarded to the chief cities in the empire,
and all previously existing copies were, by the Caliph's command,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_143" id="Page_143" href="#"><span><i>HISTORICAL VALUE OF THE KORAN</i></span>143</a></span>

committed to the flames."<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> In the text as it has come
down to us the various readings are few and unimportant, and
its genuineness is above suspicion. We shall see, <span class="sidenote"> Value of the
Koran as an
authority.</span>
moreover, that the Koran is an exceedingly
human document, reflecting every phase of
Mu&#7717;ammad's personality and standing in close relation to the
outward events of his life, so that here we have materials of
unique and incontestable authority for tracing the origin and
early development of Islam&mdash;such materials as do not exist in
the case of Buddhism or Christianity or any other ancient
religion. Unfortunately the arrangement of the Koran can
only be described as chaotic. No chronological sequence is
observed in the order of the S&uacute;ras (chapters), which is determined
simply by their length, the longest being placed first.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>
Again, the chapters themselves are sometimes made up of
disconnected fragments having nothing in common except the
rhyme; whence it is often impossible to discover the original
context of the words actually spoken by the Prophet, the
occasion on which they were revealed, or the period to which
they belong. In these circumstances the Koran must be
supplemented by reference to our second main source of information,
namely, Tradition.</p>

<p>Already in the last years of Mu&#7717;ammad's life (writes Dr.
Sprenger) it was a pious custom that when two Moslems met,
<span class="sidenote"> 2. Tradition
(&#7716;ad&iacute;th).</span>
one should ask for news (<i>&#7717;ad&iacute;th</i>) and the other
should relate a saying or anecdote of the Prophet.
After his death this custom continued, and the
name <i>&#7716;ad&iacute;th</i> was still applied to sayings and stories which
were no longer new.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> In the course of time an elaborate
system of Tradition was built up, as the Koran&mdash;originally the
sole criterion by which Moslems were guided alike in the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_144" id="Page_144" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>144</a></span>

greatest and smallest matters of public and private interest&mdash;was
found insufficient for the complicated needs of a rapidly
extending empire. Appeal was made to the sayings and
practice (<i>sunna</i>) of Mu&#7717;ammad, which now acquired "the
force of law and some of the authority of inspiration." The
Prophet had no Boswell, but almost as soon as he began to
preach he was a marked man whose <i>obiter dicta</i> could not fail
to be treasured by his Companions, and whose actions were
attentively watched. Thus, during the first century of Islam
there was a multitude of living witnesses from whom traditions
were collected, committed to memory, and orally handed down.
Every tradition consists of two parts: the text (<i>matn</i>) and the
authority (<i>sanad</i>, or <i>isn&aacute;d</i>), <i>e.g.</i>, the relater says, "I was told
by <i>A</i>, who was informed by <i>B</i>, who had it from <i>C</i>, that the
Prophet (God bless him!) and Ab&uacute; Bakr and &#8216;Umar used to <span class="sidenote"> General collections.</span>
open prayer with the words 'Praise to God, the Lord of all
creatures.'" Written records and compilations were comparatively
rare in the early period. Ibn Is&#7717;&aacute;q (&#8224;&nbsp;768 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
composed the oldest extant Biography of the Prophet, which
we do not possess, however, in its original shape <span class="sidenote"> Biographies of
Mu&#7717;ammad.</span>
but only in the recension of Ibn Hish&aacute;m
(&#8224;&nbsp;833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Two important and excellent
works of the same kind are the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Magh&aacute;z&iacute;</i> ('Book of
the Wars') by W&aacute;qid&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;822 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-&#7788;abaq&aacute;t
al-Kab&iacute;r</i> ('The Great Book of the Classes,' <i>i.e.</i>, the different
classes of Mu&#7717;ammad's Companions and those who came after
them) by Ibn Sa&#8216;d (&#8224;&nbsp;844 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Of miscellaneous traditions
intended to serve the Faithful as a model and rule of life in
every particular, and arranged in chapters according to the
subject-matter, the most ancient and authoritative
collections are those of Bukh&aacute;r&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;870 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and
Muslim (&#8224;&nbsp;874 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), both of which bear the
same title, viz., <i>al-&#7778;a&#7717;&iacute;&#7717;</i>, 'The Genuine.' It only remains to
speak of Commentaries on the Koran. Some passages were
explained by Mu&#7717;ammad himself, but the real founder of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_145" id="Page_145" href="#"><span><i>THE TRADITIONS OF MU&#7716;AMMAD</i></span>145</a></span>

Koranic Exegesis was &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. &#8216;Abb&aacute;s, the Prophet's
cousin. Although the writings of the early interpreters have
entirely perished, the gist of their researches is <span class="sidenote"> Commentaries
on the Koran.</span>
embodied in the great commentary of &#7788;abar&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;922
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), a man of encyclop&aelig;dic learning who
absorbed the whole mass of tradition existing in his time.
Subsequent commentaries are largely based on this colossal
work, which has recently been published at Cairo in thirty
volumes. That of Zamakhshar&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1143 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), which is
entitled the <i>Kashsh&aacute;f</i>, and that of Bay&#7693;&aacute;w&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1286 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) are
the best known and most highly esteemed in the Mu&#7717;ammadan
East. A work of wider scope is the <i>Itq&aacute;n</i> of Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1505
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), which takes a general survey of the Koranic sciences,
and may be regarded as an introduction to the critical study
of the Koran.</p>

<p>While every impartial student will admit the justice of
Ibn Qutayba's claim that no religion has such historical attestations
<span class="sidenote"> Character of
Moslem tradition.</span>
as Islam&mdash;<i>laysa li-ummat<sup>in</sup> mina &#8217;l-umami</i>
<i>asn&aacute;d<sup>un</sup> ka-asn&aacute;dihim</i><a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>&mdash;he must at the same
time cordially assent to the observation made by
another Mu&#7717;ammadan: "In nothing do we see pious men
more given to falsehood than in Tradition" (<i>lam nara
&#8217;l-&#7779;&aacute;li&#7717;&iacute;na f&iacute; shay&#8217;<sup>in</sup> akdhaba minhum fi &#8217;l-&#7717;ad&iacute;th</i>).<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Of this
severe judgment the reader will find ample confirmation in the
Second Part of Goldziher's <i>Muhammedanische Studien</i>.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> During
the first century of Islam the forging of Traditions became a
recognised political and religious weapon, of which all parties
availed themselves. Even men of the strictest piety practised
this species of fraud (<i>tadl&iacute;s</i>), and maintained that the end
justified the means. Their point of view is well expressed in
the following words which are supposed to have been spoken
by the Prophet: "You must compare the sayings attributed

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_146" id="Page_146" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>146</a></span>

to me with the Koran; what agrees therewith is from me,
whether I actually said it or no;" and again, " Whatever
good saying has been said, I myself have said it."<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> As the
result of such principles every new doctrine took the form of
an Apostolic <i>&#7716;ad&iacute;th</i>; every sect and every system defended
itself by an appeal to the authority of Mu&#7717;ammad. We may
see how enormous was the number of false Traditions in circulation
from the fact that when Bukh&aacute;r&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;870 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) drew up
his collection entitled 'The Genuine' (<i>al-&#7778;a&#7717;&iacute;&#7717;</i>), he limited
it to some 7,000, which he picked out of 600,000.</p>

<p>The credibility of Tradition, so far as it concerns the life of
the Prophet, cannot be discussed in this place.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The oldest
and best biography, that of Ibn Is&#7717;&aacute;q, undoubtedly contains a
great deal of fabulous matter, but his narrative appears to be
honest and fairly authentic on the whole.</p>

<p class="tb">If we accept the traditional chronology, Mu&#7717;ammad, son of
&#8216;Abdull&aacute;h and &Aacute;mina, of the tribe of Quraysh, was born at
Mecca on the 12th of Rab&iacute;&#8216; al-Awwal, in the <span class="sidenote"> Birth of
Mu&#7717;ammad.</span>
Year of the Elephant (570-571 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). His
descent from Qu&#7779;ayy is shown by the following
table:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/184image.png" width="500" height="235" alt=
"Mu&#7717;ammad's descent from Qu&#7779;ayy" title="" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_147" id="Page_147" href="#"><span><i>MU&#7716;AMMAD'S BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD</i></span>147</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after his birth he was handed over to a Bedouin
nurse&mdash;&#7716;al&iacute;ma, a woman of the Ban&uacute; Sa&#8216;d&mdash;so that until he
<span class="sidenote"> His childhood.</span>
was five years old he breathed the pure air and
learned to speak the unadulterated language of
the desert. One marvellous event which is said to have
happened to him at this time may perhaps be founded on
fact:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He and his foster-brother" (so &#7716;al&iacute;ma relates) "were among the
cattle behind our encampment when my son came running to us
and cried, 'My brother, the Qurayshite! two men clad <span class="sidenote"> Mu&#7717;ammad
and the
two angels.</span>
in white took him and laid him on his side and cleft
his belly; and they were stirring their hands in it.'
When my husband and I went out to him we found him standing
with his face turned pale, and on our asking, 'What ails thee, child?'
he answered, 'Two men wearing white garments came to me and
laid me on my side and cleft my belly and groped for something,
I know not what.' We brought him back to our tent, and my
husband said to me, 'O &#7716;al&iacute;ma, I fear this lad has been smitten
(<i>u&#7779;&iacute;ba</i>); so take him home to his family before it becomes evident.'
When we restored him to his mother she said, 'What has brought
thee, nurse? Thou wert so fond of him and anxious that he should
stay with thee.' I said, 'God has made him grow up, and I have
done my part. I feared that some mischance would befall him, so
I brought him back to thee as thou wishest.' 'Thy case is not thus,'
said she; 'tell me the truth,' and she gave me no peace until I told
her. Then she said, 'Art thou afraid that he is possessed by the
Devil?' I said, 'Yes.' 'Nay, by God,' she replied, 'the Devil
cannot reach him; my son hath a high destiny.'"<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p></div>

<p>Other versions of the story are more explicit. The angels,
it is said, drew forth Mu&#7717;ammad's heart, cleansed it, and
removed the black clot&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., the taint of original sin.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> If
these inventions have any basis at all beyond the desire to
glorify the future Prophet, we must suppose that they refer

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_148" id="Page_148" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>148</a></span>

to some kind of epileptic fit. At a later period he was
subject to such attacks, which, according to the unanimous
voice of Tradition, often coincided with the revelations sent
down from heaven.</p>

<p>&#8216;Abdull&aacute;h had died before the birth of his son, and when, in
his sixth year, Mu&#7717;ammad lost his mother also, the charge of
the orphan was undertaken first by his grandfather, the aged
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib, and then by his uncle, Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib, a poor
but honourable man, who nobly fulfilled the duties of a
guardian to the last hour of his life. Mu&#7717;ammad's small
patrimony was soon spent, and he was reduced to herding
sheep&mdash;a despised employment which usually fell to the lot
of women or slaves. In his twelfth year he accompanied
Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib on a trading expedition to Syria, in the course of
which he is said to have encountered a Christian <span class="sidenote"> His meeting
with the
monk Ba&#7717;&iacute;r&aacute;.</span>
monk called Ba&#7717;&iacute;r&aacute;, who discovered the Seal of
Prophecy between the boy's shoulders, and hailed
him as the promised apostle. Such anticipations deserve no
credit whatever. The truth is that until Mu&#7717;ammad assumed
the prophetic r&ocirc;le he was merely an obscure Qurayshite; and
scarcely anything related of him anterior to that event can be
deemed historical except his marriage to Khad&iacute;ja, an elderly
widow of considerable fortune, which took place when he was
about twenty-five years of age.</p>

<p>During the next fifteen years of his life Mu&#7717;ammad was
externally a prosperous citizen, only distinguished from those
around him by an habitual expression of thoughtful melancholy.
What was passing in his mind may be conjectured
with some probability from his first utterances when he came
forward as a preacher. It is certain, and he himself has
acknowledged, that he formerly shared the idolatry of his
countrymen. "<i>Did not He find thee astray and lead thee
aright?</i>" (Kor. xciii, 7). When and how did the process of
conversion begin? These questions cannot be answered, but
it is natural to suppose that the all-important result, on which

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_149" id="Page_149" href="#"><span><i>THE &#7716;AN&Iacute;FS</i></span>149</a></span>

Mu&#7717;ammad's biographers concentrate their attention, was preceded
by a long period of ferment and immaturity. The
idea of monotheism was represented in Arabia by the Jews,
who were particularly numerous in the &#7716;ij&aacute;z, and by several
gnostic sects of an ascetic character&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the &#7778;&aacute;bians<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> and
the Rak&uacute;sians. Furthermore, "Islamic tradition knows of
a number of religious thinkers before Mu&#7717;ammad who are
described as &#7716;an&iacute;fs,"<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> and of whom the best known are
Waraqa b. Nawfal of Quraysh; Zayd b. &#8216;Amr <span class="sidenote"> The &#7716;an&iacute;fs.</span>
b. Nufayl, also of Quraysh; and Umayya b. Abi
&#8217;l-&#7778;alt of Thaq&iacute;f. They formed no sect, as Sprenger imagined;
and more recent research has demonstrated the baselessness of
the same scholar's theory that there was in Pre-islamic times a
widely-spread religious movement which Mu&#7717;ammad organised,
directed, and employed for his own ends. His Arabian precursors,
if they may be so called, were merely a few isolated
individuals. We are told by Ibn Is&#7717;&aacute;q that Waraqa and
Zayd, together with two other Qurayshites, rejected idolatry
and left their homes in order to seek the true religion of
Abraham, but whereas Waraqa is said to have become a Christian,
Zayd remained a pious dissenter unattached either to Christianity
or to Judaism; he abstained from idol-worship, from eating
that which had died of itself, from blood, and from the flesh
of animals offered in sacrifice to idols; he condemned the
barbarous custom of burying female infants alive, and said,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_150" id="Page_150" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>150</a></span>

"I worship the Lord of Abraham."<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> As regards Umayya b.
Abi &#8217;l-&#7778;alt, according to the notice of him in the <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, he
had inspected and read the Holy Scriptures; he wore sackcloth
as a mark of devotion, held wine to be unlawful, was
inclined to disbelieve in idols, and earnestly sought the true
religion. It is said that he hoped to be sent as a prophet to
the Arabs, and therefore when Mu&#7717;ammad appeared he
envied and bitterly opposed him.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> Umayya's verses, some
of which have been translated in a former chapter,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> are
chiefly on religious topics, and show many points of resemblance
with the doctrines set forth in the early S&uacute;ras of the
Koran. With one exception, all the &#7716;an&iacute;fs whose names are
recorded belonged to the &#7716;ij&aacute;z and the west of the Arabian
peninsula. No doubt Mu&#7717;ammad, with whom most of them
were contemporary, came under their influence, and he may
have received his first stimulus from this quarter.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> While
they, however, were concerned only about their own salvation,
Mu&#7717;ammad, starting from the same position, advanced far
beyond it. His greatness lies not so much in the sublime ideas
by which he was animated as in the tremendous force and
enthusiasm of his appeal to the universal conscience of mankind.</p>

<p class="tb">In his fortieth year, it is said, Mu&#7717;ammad began to dream
dreams and see visions, and desire solitude above all things else.
He withdrew to a cave on Mount &#7716;ir&aacute;, near <span class="sidenote"> Mu&#7717;ammad's

Angel seized him with a strong grasp, saying, "Read!" and,
as Mu&#7717;ammad still refused to obey, gripped him once more
and spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>On hearing these words Mu&#7717;ammad returned, trembling,
to Khad&iacute;ja and cried, "Wrap me up! wrap me up!" and
remained covered until the terror passed away from him.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>
Another tradition relating to the same event makes it clear

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_152" id="Page_152" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>152</a></span>

that the revelation occurred in a dream.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> "I awoke," said
the Prophet, "and methought it was written in my heart."

Arabs of that time on the subject of inspiration,<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> it will not
appear surprising that Mu&#7717;ammad at first believed himself to
be possessed, like a poet or soothsayer, by one of the spirits
called collectively <i>Jinn</i>. Such was his anguish of mind that
he even meditated suicide, but Khad&iacute;ja comforted and
reassured him, and finally he gained the unalterable conviction
that he was not a prey to demoniacal influences, but a
prophet divinely inspired. For some time he received no
further revelation.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Then suddenly, as he afterwards related,
he saw the Angel seated on a throne between earth and
heaven. Awe-stricken, he ran into his house and bade them
wrap his limbs in a warm garment (<i>dith&aacute;r</i>). While he lay
thus the following verses were revealed:&mdash;</p>

<p>According to his biographers, an interval of three years
elapsed between the sending of Mu&#7717;ammad and his appearance
as a public preacher of the faith that was in him. Naturally,
he would first turn to his own family and friends, but it is
difficult to accept the statement that he made no proselytes
openly during so long a period. The contrary is asserted in an
ancient tradition related by al-Zuhr&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;742 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), where
we read that the Prophet summoned the people to embrace
Islam<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> both in private and public; and that those who
responded to his appeal were, for the most part, young men
belonging to the poorer class.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> He found, however, some
influential adherents. Besides Khad&iacute;ja, who was <span class="sidenote"> The first
Moslems.</span>
the first to believe, there were his cousin &#8216;Al&iacute;,
his adopted son, Zayd b. &#7716;&aacute;ritha, and, most important
of all, Ab&uacute; Bakr b. Ab&iacute; Quh&aacute;fa, a leading merchant of
the Quraysh, universally respected and beloved for his integrity,
wisdom, and kindly disposition. At the outset Mu&#7717;ammad
seems to have avoided everything calculated to offend the
heathens, confining himself to moral and religious generalities,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_154" id="Page_154" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>154</a></span>

so that many believed, and the Meccan aristocrats themselves
regarded him with good-humoured toleration as a harmless
oracle-monger. "Look!" they said as he passed by, "there
goes the man of the Ban&uacute; &#8216;Abd al-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib who tells of
heaven." But no sooner did he begin to emphasise the Unity
of God, to fulminate against idolatry, and to preach <span class="sidenote"> Hostility of the
Quraysh.</span>
the Resurrection of the dead, than his followers
melted away in face of the bitter antagonism
which these doctrines excited amongst the Quraysh, who saw
in the Ka&#8216;ba and its venerable cult the mainspring of their
commercial prosperity, and were irritated by the Prophet's
declaration that their ancestors were burning in hell-fire.
The authority of Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib secured the personal safety of
Mu&#7717;ammad; of the little band who remained faithful some
were protected by the strong family feeling characteristic of old
Arabian society, but many were poor and friendless; and these,
especially the slaves, whom the levelling ideas of Islam had
attracted in large numbers, were subjected to cruel persecution.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a>
Nevertheless Mu&#7717;ammad continued to preach. "I will not
forsake this cause" (thus he is said to have answered Ab&uacute;
&#7788;&aacute;lib, who informed him of the threatening attitude of the
Quraysh and begged him not to lay on him a greater burden
than he could bear) "until God shall make it prevail or until
I shall perish therein&mdash;not though they should set the sun on
my right hand and the moon on my left!"<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> But progress

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_155" id="Page_155" href="#"><span><i>FAILURE OF THE MISSION AT MECCA</i></span>155</a></span>

was slow and painful: the Meccans stood obstinately aloof,
deriding both his prophetic authority and the Divine chastisement
with which he sought to terrify them. Moreover, they
used every kind of pressure short of actual violence in order to
seduce his followers, so that many recanted, and in the fifth
year of his mission he saw himself driven to the necessity of
commanding a general emigration to the Christian <span class="sidenote"> Emigration to
Abyssinia.</span>
kingdom of Abyssinia, where the Moslems would
be received with open arms<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> and would be withdrawn
from temptation.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> About a hundred men and women
went into exile, leaving their Prophet with a small party of
staunch and devoted comrades to persevere in a struggle that
was daily becoming more difficult. In a moment of weakness
Mu&#7717;ammad resolved to attempt a compromise <span class="sidenote"> Temporary
reconciliation
with the
Quraysh.</span>
with his countrymen. One day, it is said, the
chief men of Mecca, assembled in a group beside
the Ka&#8216;ba, discussed as was their wont the affairs of the city,
when Mu&#7717;ammad appeared and, seating himself by them in
a friendly manner, began to recite in their hearing the 53rd
S&uacute;ra of the Koran. When he came to the verses (19-20)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Do ye see Al-L&aacute;t and Al-&#8216;Uzz&aacute;, and Man&aacute;t, the third and last?"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Satan prompted him to add:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"These are the most exalted Cranes (or Swans),</span><span class="i0">
And verily their intercession is to be hoped for."</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Quraysh were surprised and delighted with this
acknowledgment of their deities; and as Mu&#7717;ammad wound
up the S&uacute;ra with the closing words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Wherefore bow down before God and serve Him,"</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_156" id="Page_156" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>156</a></span></p>

<p>the whole assembly prostrated themselves with one accord
on the ground and worshipped.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> But scarcely had Mu&#7717;ammad
returned to his house when he repented of the sin into
which he had fallen. He cancelled the idolatrous verses
and revealed in their place those which now stand in the
Koran&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Shall yours be the male and his the female?<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span><span class="i0">
This were then an unjust division!</span><span class="i0">
They are naught but names which ye and your fathers have named."</span>
</div></div>

<p>We can easily comprehend why Ibn Hish&aacute;m omits all
mention of this episode from his Biography, and why the fact
<span class="sidenote">Mu&#7717;ammad's
concession to
the idolaters.</span>
itself is denied by many Moslem theologians.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
The Prophet's friends were scandalised, his
enemies laughed him to scorn. It was probably
no sudden lapse, as tradition represents, but a calculated
endeavour to come to terms with the Quraysh; and so far
from being immediately annulled, the reconciliation seems
to have lasted long enough for the news of it to reach the
emigrants in Abyssinia and induce some of them to return to
Mecca. While putting the best face on the matter,
Mu&#7717;ammad felt keenly both his own disgrace and the public
discredit. It speaks well for his sincerity that, as soon as
he perceived any compromise with idolatry to be impossible&mdash;to
be, in fact, a surrender of the great principle by which he
was inspired&mdash;he frankly confessed his error and delusion.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_157" id="Page_157" href="#"><span><i>BACKSLIDING AND REPENTANCE</i></span>157</a></span>

Henceforth he "wages mortal strife with images in every
shape"&mdash;there is no god but Allah.</p>

<p>The further course of events which culminated in
Mu&#7717;ammad's Flight to Med&iacute;na may be sketched in a few
words. Persecution now waxed hotter than ever, as the
Prophet, rising from his temporary vacillation like a giant
refreshed, threw his whole force into the denunciation of
idolatry. The conversion of &#8216;Umar b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b, the future
Caliph, a man of 'blood and iron,' gave the signal for open
revolt. "The Moslems no longer concealed their worship
within their own dwellings, but with conscious strength and
defiant attitude assembled in companies about the Ka&#8216;ba, performed
their rites of prayer and compassed the Holy House.
Their courage rose. Dread and uneasiness seized the
Quraysh." The latter retaliated by cutting off all relations
with the H&aacute;shimites, who were pledged to defend their kinsman,
whether they recognised him as a prophet or no. This
ban or boycott secluded them in an outlying quarter of the city,
where for more than two years they endured the utmost
privations, but it only cemented their loyalty to Mu&#7717;ammad,
and ultimately dissensions among the Quraysh themselves caused
it to be removed. Shortly afterwards the Prophet suffered
a double bereavement&mdash;the death of his wife, <span class="sidenote"> Death of
of Khad&iacute;ja and
Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib.</span>
Khad&iacute;ja, was followed by that of the noble Ab&uacute;
&#7788;&aacute;lib, who, though he never accepted Islam,
stood firm to the last in defence of his brother's son. Left
alone to protect himself, Mu&#7717;ammad realised that he must take
some decisive step. The situation was critical. Events had
shown that he had nothing to hope and everything to fear from
the Meccan aristocracy. He had warned them again and
again of the wrath to come, yet they gave no heed. He was
now convinced that they would not and could not believe,
since God in His inscrutable wisdom had predestined them to
eternal damnation. Consequently he resolved on a bold and,
according to Arab ways of thinking, abominable expedient,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_158" id="Page_158" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>158</a></span>

namely, to abandon his fellow-tribesmen and seek aid from
strangers.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Having vainly appealed to the inhabitants of
&#7788;&aacute;&#8217;if, he turned to Med&iacute;na, where, among a population
largely composed of Jews, the revolutionary ideas of Islam
might more readily take root and flourish than in the
Holy City of Arabian heathendom. This time he was not
disappointed. A strong party in Med&iacute;na hailed him as the
true Prophet, eagerly embraced his creed, and swore to defend
him at all hazards. In the spring of the year 622 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> the
Moslems of Mecca quietly left their homes and journeyed
northward. A few months later (September, 622) Mu&#7717;ammad
himself, eluding the vigilance of the Quraysh, entered Med&iacute;na
in triumph amidst the crowds and acclamations due to a
conqueror.</p>

<p>This is the celebrated Migration or Hegira (properly <i>Hijra</i>)
which marks the end of the Barbaric Age (<i>al-J&aacute;hiliyya</i>) and
<span class="sidenote">The <i>Hijra</i> or
Migration to
Medina
(622 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
the beginning of the Mu&#7717;ammadan Era. It also
marks a new epoch in the Prophet's history; but
before attempting to indicate the nature of the
change it will be convenient, in order that we may form
a juster conception of his character, to give some account of
his early teaching and preaching as set forth in that portion of
the Koran which was revealed at Mecca.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_159" id="Page_159" href="#"><span><i>THE FLIGHT TO MEDINA</i></span>159</a></span>

Koran (Qur&#8217;&aacute;n) is derived from the Arabic root <i>qara&#8217;a</i>,
'to read,' and means 'reading aloud' or 'chanting.' This
<span class="sidenote"> The Koran.</span>
term may be applied either to a single Revelation
or to several recited together or, in its usual acceptation,
to the whole body of Revelations which are thought
by Moslems to be, actually and literally, the Word of God; so
that in quoting from the Koran they say <i>q&aacute;la &#8217;ll&aacute;hu</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
'God said.' Each Revelation forms a separate <i>S&uacute;ra</i>
(chapter)<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> composed of verses of varying length which have
no metre but are generally rhymed. Thus, as regards its
external features, the style of the Koran is modelled upon the
<i>Saj&#8216;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> or rhymed prose, of the pagan soothsayers, but with such
freedom that it may fairly be described as original. Since it
was not in Mu&#7717;ammad's power to create a form that should
be absolutely new, his choice lay between <i>Saj&#8216;</i> and poetry, the
only forms of elevated style then known to the Arabs. He
himself declared that he was no poet,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> and this is true in the
sense that he may have lacked the technical accomplishment of
verse-making. It must, however, be borne in <span class="sidenote"> Was Mu&#7717;ammad
poet?</span>
mind that his disavowal does not refer primarily
to the poetic art, but rather to the person and
character of the poets themselves. He, the divinely inspired
Prophet, could have nothing to do with men who owed their
inspiration to demons and gloried in the ideals of paganism
which he was striving to overthrow. "<i>And the poets do
those follow who go astray! Dost thou not see that they
wander distraught in every vale? and that they say that which
they do not?</i>" (Kor. xxvi, 224-226). Mu&#7717;ammad was not
of these; although he was not so unlike them as he pretended.
His kinship with the pagan <i>Sh&aacute;&#8216;ir</i> is clearly shown, for example,
in the 113th and 114th S&uacute;ras, which are charms against magic
and <i>diablerie</i>, as well as in the solemn imprecation calling down
destruction upon the head of his uncle, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-&#8216;Uzz&aacute;, nicknamed
Ab&uacute; Lahab (Father of Flame).</p>

<p>If, then, we must allow that Mu&#7717;ammad's contemporaries had
some justification for bestowing upon him the title of poet
against which he protested so vehemently, still less can his plea
be accepted by the modern critic, whose verdict will be that
the Koran is not poetical as a whole; that it contains many
pages of rhetoric and much undeniable prose; but that,
although Mu&#7717;ammad needed "heaven-sent moments for this
skill," in the early Meccan S&uacute;ras frequently, and fitfully elsewhere,
his genius proclaims itself by grand lyrical outbursts
which could never have been the work of a mere rhetorician.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mu&#7717;ammad's single aim in the Meccan S&uacute;ras," says N&ouml;ldeke, "is to
convert the people, by means of persuasion, from their false gods to

S&uacute;ras.</span>
the One God. To whatever point the discourse is
directed, this always remains the ground-thought; but
instead of seeking to convince the reason of his
hearers by logical proofs, he employs the arts of rhetoric to
work upon their minds through the imagination. Thus he glorifies
God, describes His working in Nature and History, and ridicules
on the other hand the impotence of the idols. Especially
important are the descriptions of the everlasting bliss of the pious
and the torments of the wicked: these, particularly the latter, must
be regarded as one of the mightiest factors in the propagation of
Islam, through the impression which they make on the imagination
of simple men who have not been hardened, from their youth up, by
similar theological ideas. The Prophet often attacks his heathen
adversaries personally and threatens them with eternal punishment;
but while he is living among heathens alone, he seldom assails the
Jews who stand much nearer to him, and the Christians scarcely
ever."<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p></div>

The preposterous arrangement of the Koran, to which I have
already adverted, is mainly responsible for the opinion almost
unanimously held by European readers that it is obscure, tiresome,
uninteresting; a farrago of long-winded narratives and
prosaic exhortations, quite unworthy to be named in the same
breath with the Prophetical Books of the Old Testament.
One may, indeed, peruse the greater part of the volume,
beginning with the first chapter, and find but a few passages of
genuine enthusiasm to relieve the prevailing dulness. It is in
the short S&uacute;ras placed at the end of the Koran that we must
look for evidence of Mu&#7717;ammad's prophetic gift. These are the
earliest of all; in these the flame of inspiration burns purely
and its natural force is not abated. The following versions,
like those which have preceded, imitate the original form as
closely, I think, as is possible in English. They cannot, of
course, do more than faintly suggest the striking effect of the
sonorous Arabic when read aloud. The Koran was designed
for oral recitation, and it must be <i>heard</i> in order to be justly
appraised.</p>

<p>To summarise the cardinal doctrines preached by Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="sidenote">The teaching of
Mu&#7717;ammad at
Mecca.</span>
during the Meccan period:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. There is no god but God.</p>

<p>2. Mu&#7717;ammad is the Apostle of God, and the
Koran is the Word of God revealed to His Apostle.</p>

<p>3. The dead shall be raised to life at the Last Judgment,
when every one shall be judged by his actions in the present life.</p>

<p>4. The pious shall enter Paradise and the wicked shall go
down to Hell.</p>

<p>Taking these doctrines separately, let us consider a little
more in detail how each of them is stated and by what arguments
it is enforced. The time had not yet come for drawing

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_164" id="Page_164" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>164</a></span>

the sword: Mu&#7717;ammad repeats again and again that he is only
a warner (<i>nadh&iacute;r</i>) invested with no authority to compel where
he cannot persuade.</p>

<p>1. The Meccans acknowledged the supreme position of
Allah, but in ordinary circumstances neglected him in favour
<span class="sidenote">The Unity of
God.</span>
of their idols, so that, as Mu&#7717;ammad complains,
"<i>When danger befalls you on the sea, the gods
whom ye invoke are forgotten except Him alone;
yet when He brought you safe to land, ye turned your backs on
Him, for Man is ungrateful.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> They were strongly attached
to the cult of the Ka&#8216;ba, not only by self-interest, but also by
the more respectable motives of piety towards their ancestors
and pride in their traditions. Mu&#7717;ammad himself regarded
Allah as Lord of the Ka&#8216;ba, and called upon the Quraysh
to worship him as such (Kor. cvi, 3). When they refused to
do so on the ground that they were afraid lest the Arabs should
rise against them and drive them forth from the land, he
assured them that Allah was the author of all their prosperity
(Kor. xxviii, 57). His main argument, however, is drawn
from the weakness of the idols, which cannot create even a
fly, contrasted with the wondrous manifestations of Divine
power and providence in the creation of the heavens and the
earth and all living things.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>It was probably towards the close of the Meccan period that
Mu&#7717;ammad summarised his Unitarian ideas in the following
emphatic formula:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_165" id="Page_165" href="#"><span><i>CARDINAL DOCTRINES</i></span>165</a></span>

2. We have seen that when Mu&#7717;ammad first appeared as
a prophet he was thought by all except a very few to
<span class="sidenote"> Mu&#7717;ammad, the
Apostle of
God.</span>
be <i>majn&uacute;n</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, possessed by a <i>jinn&iacute;</i>, or genie,
if I may use a word which will send the reader
back to his <i>Arabian Nights</i>. The heathen Arabs
regarded such persons&mdash;soothsayers, diviners, and poets&mdash;with
a certain respect; and if Mu&#7717;ammad's 'madness' had taken a
normal course, his claim to inspiration would have passed
unchallenged. What moved the Quraysh to oppose him was
not disbelief in his inspiration&mdash;it mattered little to them
whether he was under the spell of Allah or one of the <i>Jinn</i>&mdash;but
the fact that he preached doctrines which wounded their
sentiments, threatened their institutions, and subverted the
most cherished traditions of old Arabian life. But in order
successfully to resist the propaganda for which he alleged a
Divine warrant, they were obliged to meet him on his own
ground and to maintain that he was no prophet at all, no
Apostle of Allah, as he asserted, but "an insolent liar," "a
schooled madman," "an infatuated poet," and so forth; and
that his Koran, which he gave out to be the Word of Allah,
was merely "old folks' tales" (<i>as&aacute;&#7789;&iacute;ru &#8217;l-awwal&iacute;n</i>), or the
invention of a poet or a sorcerer. "Is not he," they cried, "a
man like ourselves, who wishes to domineer over us? Let
him show us a miracle, that we may believe." Mu&#7717;ammad
could only reiterate his former assertions and warn the infidels
that a terrible punishment was in store for them either in this
world or the next. Time after time he compares himself to
the ancient prophets&mdash;Noah, Abraham, Moses, and their
successors&mdash;who are represented as employing exactly the
same arguments and receiving the same answers as Mu&#7717;ammad;
and bids his people hearken to him lest they utterly
perish like the ungodly before them. The truth of the Koran
is proved, he says, by the Pentateuch and the Gospel, all being
Revelations of the One God, and therefore identical in
substance. He is no mercenary soothsayer, he seeks no

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_166" id="Page_166" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>166</a></span>

personal advantage: his mission is solely to preach. The
demand for a miracle he could not satisfy except by pointing
to his visions of the Angel and especially to the Koran itself,
every verse of which was a distinct sign or miracle (<i>&aacute;yat</i>).<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> If
he has forged it, why are his adversaries unable to produce anything
similar? "<i>Say: 'If men and genies united to bring the
like of this Koran, they could not bring the like although they
should back each other up'</i>" (Kor. xvii, 90).</p>

<p>3. Such notions of a future life as were current in Pre-islamic
Arabia never rose beyond vague and barbarous superstition,
<span class="sidenote"> Resurrection
and
Retribution.</span>
<i>e.g.</i>, the fancy that the dead man's tomb
was haunted by his spirit in the shape of a
screeching owl.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> No wonder, then, that the
ideas of Resurrection and Retribution, which are enforced by
threats and arguments on almost every page of the Koran,
appeared to the Meccan idolaters absurdly ridiculous and
incredible. "<i>Does Ibn Kabsha promise us that we shall live?</i>"
said one of their poets. "<i>How can there be life for the &#7779;ad&aacute;
and the h&aacute;ma? Dost thou omit to ward me from death, and wilt
thou revive me when my bones are rotten?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> God provided His
Apostle with a ready answer to these gibes: "<i>Say: 'He shall
revive them who produced them at first, for He knoweth every</i>

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_167" id="Page_167" href="#"><span><i>CONCEPTIONS OF THE FUTURE LIFE</i></span>167</a></span>

<i>creation</i>" (Kor. xxxvi, 79). This topic is eloquently illustrated,
but Mu&#7717;ammad's hearers were probably less impressed by the
creative power of God as exhibited in Nature and in Man
than by the awful examples, to which reference has been
made, of His destructive power as manifested in History. To
Mu&#7717;ammad himself, at the outset of his mission, it seemed an
appalling certainty that he must one day stand before God and
render an account; the overmastering sense of his own responsibility
goaded him to preach in the hope of saving his
countrymen, and supplied him, weak and timorous as he was,
with strength to endure calumny and persecution. As N&ouml;ldeke
has remarked, the grandest S&uacute;ras of the whole Koran are those
in which Mu&#7717;ammad describes how all Nature trembles and
quakes at the approach of the Last Judgment. "It is as
though one actually saw the earth heaving, the mountains
crumbling to dust, and the stars hurled hither and thither in
wild confusion."<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> S&uacute;ras lxxxii and ci, which have been
translated above, are specimens of the true prophetic style.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>4. There is nothing spiritual in Mu&#7717;ammad's pictures of
Heaven and Hell. His Paradise is simply a glorified pleasure-garden,
<span class="sidenote"> The
Mu&#7717;ammadan
Paradise.</span>
where the pious repose in cool shades,
quaffing spicy wine and diverting themselves with
the Houris (<i>&#7716;&uacute;r</i>), lovely dark-eyed damsels like
pearls hidden in their shells.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> This was admirably calculated
to allure his hearers by reminding them of one of their chief
enjoyments&mdash;the gay drinking parties which occasionally
broke the monotony of Arabian life, and which are often
described in Pre-islamic poetry; indeed, it is highly probable
that Mu&#7717;ammad drew a good deal of his Paradise from this
source. The gross and sensual character of the Mu&#7717;ammadan
Afterworld is commonly thought to betray a particular weakness

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_168" id="Page_168" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>168</a></span>

of the Prophet or is charged to the Arabs in general, but
as Professor Bevan has pointed out, "the real explanation
seems to be that at first the idea of a future retribution was
absolutely new both to Mu&#7717;ammad himself and to the public
which he addressed. Paradise and Hell had no traditional
associations, and the Arabic language furnished no religious
terminology for the expression of such ideas; if they were to
be made comprehensible at all, it could only be done by means
of precise descriptions, of imagery borrowed from earthly
affairs."<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammad was no mere visionary. Ritual observances,
vigils, and other austerities entered largely into his religion,
<span class="sidenote"> Prayer.</span>
endowing it with the formal and ascetic character
which it retains to the present day. Prayer was
introduced soon after the first Revelations: in one of the oldest
(S&uacute;ra lxxxvii, 14-15) we read, "<i>Prosperous is he who purifies
himself (or gives alms) and repeats the name of his Lord and
prays.</i>" Although the five daily prayers obligatory upon every
true believer are nowhere mentioned in the Koran, the opening
chapter (<i>S&uacute;ratu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ti&#7717;a</i>), which answers to our Lord's
Prayer, is constantly recited on these occasions, and is seldom
omitted from any act of public or private devotion. Since the
<i>F&aacute;ti&#7717;a</i> probably belongs to the latest Meccan period, it may
find a place here.</p>

About the same time, shortly before the Migration, Mu&#7717;ammad
dreamed that he was transported from the Ka&#8216;ba to the
<span class="sidenote"> The Night
journey and
Ascension
of Mu&#7717;ammad.</span>
Temple at Jerusalem, and thence up to the seventh
heaven. The former part of the vision is indicated
in the Koran (xvii, 1): "<i>Glory to him who took His
servant a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque
to the Farthest Mosque, the precinct whereof we have blessed,
to show him of our signs!</i>" Tradition has wondrously embellished
the <i>Mi&#8216;r&aacute;j</i>, by which name the Ascension of the
Prophet is generally known throughout the East; while in
Persia and Turkey it has long been a favourite theme for the
mystic and the poet. According to the popular belief, which
is also held by the majority of Moslem divines, Mu&#7717;ammad
was transported in the body to his journey's end, but he
himself never countenanced this literal interpretation, though
it seems to have been current in Mecca, and we are told that
it caused some of his incredulous followers to abandon their
faith.</p>

<p>Possessed and inspired by the highest idea of which man
is capable, fearlessly preaching the truth revealed to him,
leading almost alone what long seemed to be a forlorn hope
against the impregnable stronghold of superstition, yet facing
these tremendous odds with a calm resolution which yielded
nothing to ridicule or danger, but defied his enemies to do their
worst&mdash;Mu&#7717;ammad in the early part of his career presents a
spectacle of grandeur which cannot fail to win our sympathy
and admiration. At Med&iacute;na, whither we must <span class="sidenote"> Mu&#7717;ammad at
Med&iacute;na.</span>
now return, he appears in a less favourable light:
the days of pure religious enthusiasm have passed
away for ever, and the Prophet is overshadowed by the
Statesman. The Migration was undoubtedly essential to the
establishment of Islam. It was necessary that Mu&#7717;ammad
should cut himself off from his own people in order that he
might found a community in which not blood but religion
formed the sole bond that was recognised. This task he

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_170" id="Page_170" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>170</a></span>

accomplished with consummate sagacity and skill, though some
of the methods which he employed can only be excused by his
conviction that whatever he did was done in the name of Allah.
As the supreme head of the Moslem theocracy both in spiritual
and temporal matters&mdash;for Islam allows no distinction between
Church and State&mdash;he exercised absolute authority, and he did
not hesitate to justify by Divine mandate acts of which the
heathen Arabs, cruel and treacherous as they were, might have
been ashamed to be guilty. We need not inquire how much
was due to belief in his inspiration and how much to deliberate
policy. If it revolts us to see God Almighty introduced in the
r&ocirc;le of special pleader, we ought to remember that Mu&#7717;ammad,
being what he was, could scarcely have considered the question
from that point of view.</p>

<p>The conditions prevailing at Med&iacute;na were singularly adapted
to his design. Ever since the famous battle of Bu&#8216;&aacute;th (about
<span class="sidenote"> Med&iacute;na
predisposed to
welcome
Mu&#7717;ammad as
Legislator and
Prophet.</span>
615 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in which the Ban&uacute; Aws, with the help
of their Jewish allies, the Ban&uacute; Quray&#7827;a and the
Ban&uacute; Na&#7693;&iacute;r, inflicted a crushing defeat upon the
Ban&uacute; Khazraj, the city had been divided into two
hostile camps; and if peace had hitherto been
preserved, it was only because both factions were too exhausted
to renew the struggle. Wearied and distracted by earthly
calamities, men's minds willingly admit the consolations of
religion. We find examples of this tendency at Med&iacute;na even
before the Migration. Ab&uacute; &#8216;&Aacute;mir, whose ascetic life gained for
him the title of 'The Monk' (<i>al-R&aacute;hib</i>), is numbered among
the <i>&#7716;an&iacute;fs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> He fought in the ranks of the Quraysh at U&#7717;ud,
and finally went to Syria, where he died an outlaw. Another
Pre-islamic monotheist of Med&iacute;na, Ab&uacute; Qays b. Ab&iacute; Anas, is
said to have turned Moslem in his old age.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The inhabitants of Med&iacute;na had no material interest in idol-worship
and no sanctuary to guard. Through uninterrupted
contact with the Jews of the city and neighbourhood, as also
with the Christian tribes settled in the extreme north of Arabia on

the confines of the Byzantine Empire, they had learned, as it were
instinctively, to despise their inherited belief in idols and to respect
the far nobler and purer faith in a single God; and lastly, they had
become accustomed to the idea of a Divine revelation by means of a
special scripture of supernatural origin, like the Pentateuch and the
Gospel. From a religious standpoint paganism in Med&iacute;na offered
no resistance to Islam: as a faith, it was dead before it was attacked;
none defended it, none mourned its disappearance. The pagan
opposition to Mu&#7717;ammad's work as a reformer was entirely political,
and proceeded from those who wished to preserve the anarchy of
the old heathen life, and who disliked the dictatorial rule of
Mu&#7717;ammad."<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p></div>

<p>There were in Med&iacute;na four principal parties, consisting of
those who either warmly supported or actively opposed the
<span class="sidenote"> Parties in
Med&iacute;na.</span>
Prophet, or who adopted a relatively neutral
attitude, viz., the Emigrants (<i>Muh&aacute;jir&uacute;n</i>), the
Helpers (<i>An&#7779;&aacute;r</i>), the Hypocrites (<i>Mun&aacute;fiq&uacute;n</i>),
and the Jews (<i>Yah&uacute;d</i>).</p>

<p>The Emigrants were those Moslems who left their homes
at Mecca and accompanied the Prophet in his Migration (<i>Hijra</i>)&mdash;whence
<span class="sidenote">The Emigrants.</span>
their name, <i>Muh&aacute;jir&uacute;n</i>&mdash;to Med&iacute;na in
the year 622. Inasmuch as they had lost everything
except the hope of victory and vengeance, he could
count upon their fanatical devotion to himself.</p>

<p>The Helpers were those inhabitants of Med&iacute;na who had
accepted Islam and pledged themselves to protect Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="sidenote"> The Helpers.</span>
in case of attack. Together with the Emigrants
they constituted a formidable and ever-increasing
body of true believers, the first champions of the Church
militant.</p>

<p>Their leader, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Ubayy, an able man but of weak
character, was no match for Mu&#7717;ammad, whom he and his
partisans only irritated, without ever becoming really
dangerous.</p>

<p>The Jews, on the other hand, gave the Prophet serious
trouble. At first he cherished high hopes that they would
<span class="sidenote"> The Jews.</span>
accept the new Revelation which he brought to
them, and which he maintained to be the original
Word of God as it was formerly revealed to Abraham and
Moses; but when the Jews, perceiving the absurdity of this
idea, plied him with all sorts of questions and made merry
over his ignorance, Mu&#7717;ammad, keenly alive to the damaging
effect of the criticism to which he had exposed himself, turned
upon his tormentors, and roundly accused them of having
falsified and corrupted their Holy Books. Henceforth he
pursued them with a deadly hatred against which their
political disunion rendered them helpless. A few sought
refuge in Islam; the rest were either slaughtered or driven
into exile.</p>

<p>It is impossible to detail here the successive steps by which

Mu&#7717;ammad in the course of a few years overcame all
opposition and established the supremacy of Islam from
one end of Arabia to the other. I shall notice the outstanding
events very briefly in order to make room for
matters which are more nearly connected with the subject
of this History.</p>

<p class="tb">Mu&#7717;ammad's first care was to reconcile the desperate
factions within the city and to introduce law and order
<span class="sidenote"> Beginnings of
the Moslem
State.</span>
among the heterogeneous elements which have
been described. "He drew up in writing a
charter between the Emigrants and the Helpers,
in which charter he embodied a covenant with the Jews,
confirming them in the exercise of their religion and in the
possession of their properties, imposing upon them certain
obligations, and granting to them certain rights."<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> This
remarkable document is extant in Ibn Hish&aacute;m's <i>Biography of
Mu&#7717;ammad</i>, pp. 341-344. Its contents have been analysed
in masterly fashion by Wellhausen,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> who observes with justice
that it was no solemn covenant, accepted and duly ratified by
representatives of the parties concerned, but merely a decree
of Mu&#7717;ammad based upon conditions already existing which
had developed since his arrival in Med&iacute;na. At the same time
no one can study it without being impressed by the political
genius of its author. Ostensibly a cautious and tactful reform,
it was in reality a revolution. Mu&#7717;ammad durst not strike
openly at the independence of the tribes, but he destroyed it,
in effect, by shifting the centre of power from the tribe to the
community; and although the community included Jews and
pagans as well as Moslems, he fully recognised, what his
opponents failed to foresee, that the Moslems were the active,
and must soon be the predominant, partners in the newly
founded State.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_174" id="Page_174" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>174</a></span>

All was now ripe for the inevitable struggle with the
Quraysh, and God revealed to His Apostle several verses of
the Koran in which the Faithful are commanded to wage a
Holy War against them: "<i>Permission is given to those who
fight because they have been wronged,&mdash;and verily God to help
them has the might,&mdash;who have been driven forth from their
homes undeservedly, only for that they said, 'Our Lord is
God'</i>" (xxii, 40-41). "<i>Kill them wherever ye find them,
and drive them out from whence they drive you out</i>" (ii, 187).
"<i>Fight them that there be no sedition and that the religion
may be God's</i>" (ii, 189). In January, 624 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Moslems,
some three hundred strong, won a glorious victory at Badr
over a greatly superior force which had marched <span class="sidenote">Battle of Badr,
January, 624 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></span>
out from Mecca to relieve a rich caravan that
Mu&#7717;ammad threatened to cut off. The Quraysh
fought bravely, but were borne down by the irresistible onset
of men who had learned discipline in the mosque and looked
upon death as a sure passport to Paradise. Of the Moslems
only fourteen fell; the Quraysh lost forty-nine killed and
about the same number of prisoners. But the importance of
Mu&#7717;ammad's success cannot be measured by the material
damage which he inflicted. Considering the momentous issues
involved, we must allow that Badr, like Marathon, is one of
the greatest and most memorable battles in all history. Here,
at last, was the miracle which the Prophet's enemies demanded
of him: "<i>Ye have had a sign in the two parties who met;
one party fighting in the way of God, the other misbelieving;
these saw twice the same number as themselves to the eyesight,
for God aids with His help those whom He pleases.
Verily in that is a lesson for those who have perception</i>"
(Kor. iii, 11). And again, "<i>Ye slew them not, but God slew
them</i>" (Kor. viii, 17). The victory of Badr turned all eyes
upon Mu&#7717;ammad. However little the Arabs cared for his
religion, they could not but respect the man who had humbled
the lords of Mecca. He was now a power in the land&mdash;

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_175" id="Page_175" href="#"><span><i>TRIUMPH OF THE PROPHET</i></span>175</a></span>

"Mu&#7717;ammad, King of the &#7716;ij&aacute;z."<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> In Med&iacute;na his cause
flourished mightily. The zealots were confirmed in their
faith, the waverers convinced, the disaffected overawed. He
sustained a serious, though temporary, check in the following
year at U&#7717;ud, where a Moslem army was routed <span class="sidenote">Battle of U&#7717;ud,
625 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></span>
by the Quraysh under Ab&uacute; Sufy&aacute;n, but the
victors were satisfied with having taken vengeance
for Badr and made no attempt to follow up their advantage;
while Mu&#7717;ammad, never resting on his laurels, never losing
sight of the goal, proceeded with remorseless calculation to
crush his adversaries one after the other, until in January,
630 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Meccans themselves, seeing the futility of
further resistance, opened their gates to the <span class="sidenote">Submission of
Mecca, 630 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></span>
Prophet and acknowledged the omnipotence of
Allah. The submission of the Holy City left
Mu&#7717;ammad without a rival in Arabia. His work was almost
done. Deputations from the Bedouin tribes poured into
Med&iacute;na, offering allegiance to the conqueror of the Quraysh,
and reluctantly subscribing to a religion in which they saw
nothing so agreeable as the prospect of plundering its enemies.</p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammad died, after a brief illness, on the 8th of June,
632 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> He was succeeded as head of the Moslem community
<span class="sidenote">Death of
Mu&#7717;ammad,
632 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></span>
by his old friend and ever-loyal supporter,
Ab&uacute; Bakr, who thus became the first <i>Khal&iacute;fa</i>, or
Caliph. It only remains to take up our survey of
the Koran, which we have carried down to the close of the
Meccan period, and to indicate the character and contents of
the Revelation during the subsequent decade.</p>

<p class="tb">The Med&iacute;na S&uacute;ras faithfully reflect the marvellous change
in Mu&#7717;ammad's fortunes, which began with his flight from
Mecca. He was now recognised as the Prophet and Apostle
of God, but this recognition made him an earthly potentate
and turned his religious activity into secular channels. One

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_176" id="Page_176" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>176</a></span>

who united in himself the parts of prince, legislator, politician,
diplomatist, and general may be excused if he sometimes neglected
the Divine injunction to arise and preach, <span class="sidenote"> The Med&iacute;na
S&uacute;ras.</span>
or at any rate interpreted it in a sense very different
from that which he formerly attached to it.
The Revelations of this time deal, to a large extent, with
matters of legal, social, and political interest; they promulgate
religious ordinances&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, fasting, alms-giving, and pilgrimage&mdash;expound
the laws of marriage and divorce, and comment upon
the news of the day; often they serve as bulletins or manifestoes
in which Mu&#7717;ammad justifies what he has done, urges
the Moslems to fight and rebukes the laggards, moralises on a
victory or defeat, proclaims a truce, and says, in short, whatever
the occasion seems to require. Instead of the Meccan idolaters,
his opponents in Med&iacute;na&mdash;the Jews and Hypocrites&mdash;have
become the great rocks of offence; the Jews especially are
denounced in long passages as a stiff-necked generation who
never hearkened to their own prophets of old. However
valuable historically, the Med&iacute;na S&uacute;ras do not attract the
literary reader. In their flat and tedious style they resemble
those of the later Meccan period. Now and again the ashes
burst into flame, though such moments of splendour are
increasingly rare, as in the famous 'Throne-verse' (<i>&Aacute;yatu
&#8217;l-Kurs&iacute;</i>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"God, there is no god but He, the living, the self-subsistent.
Slumber takes Him not, nor sleep. His is what is in the heavens
<span class="sidenote"> The 'Throne-verse.'</span>
and what is in the earth. Who is it that intercedes
with Him save by His permission? He knows what
is before them and what behind them, and they comprehend
not aught of His knowledge but of what He pleases. His
throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and it tires Him not
to guard them both, for He is high and grand."<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p></div>

<p>The Islam which Mu&#7717;ammad brought with him to Med&iacute;na
was almost entirely derived by oral tradition from Christianity

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_177" id="Page_177" href="#"><span><i>THE MED&Iacute;NA S&Uacute;RAS</i></span>177</a></span>

and Judaism, and just for this reason it made little impression
on the heathen Arabs, whose religious ideas were generally
of the most primitive kind. Notwithstanding its foreign
character and the absence of anything which appealed to
Arabian national sentiment, it spread rapidly in Med&iacute;na,
where, as we have seen, the soil was already prepared for it;
but one may well doubt whether it could have extended its
sway over the peninsula unless the course of events had determined
Mu&#7717;ammad to associate the strange doctrines of Islam
with the ancient heathen sanctuary at Mecca, the Ka&#8216;ba,
which was held in universal veneration by the Arabs and
formed the centre of a worship that raised no difficulties in
their minds. Before he had lived many months <span class="sidenote"> The nationalisation
of Islam.</span>
in Med&iacute;na the Prophet realised that his hope of
converting the Jews was doomed to disappointment.
Accordingly he instructed his followers that they
should no longer turn their faces in prayer towards the
Temple at Jerusalem, as they had been accustomed to do
since the Flight, but towards the Ka&#8216;ba; while, a year or two
later, he incorporated in Islam the superstitious ceremonies of
the pilgrimage, which were represented as having been originally
prescribed to Abraham, the legendary founder of the
Ka&#8216;ba, whose religion he professed to restore.</p>

<p>These concessions, however, were far from sufficient to
reconcile the free-living and freethinking people of the
desert to a religion which restrained their pleasures, forced
them to pay taxes and perform prayers, and stamped with the
name of barbarism all the virtues they held most dear. The
teaching of Islam ran directly counter to the ideals and
traditions of heathendom, and, as Goldziher has remarked,
its originality lies not in its doctrines, which are Jewish and
Christian, but in the fact that it was Mu&#7717;ammad who first
maintained these doctrines with persistent energy against the
Arabian view of life.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> While we must refer the reader to Dr.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_178" id="Page_178" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>178</a></span>

Goldziher's illuminating pages for a full discussion of the conflict
between the new Religion (<i>D&iacute;n</i>) and the old Virtue
(<i>Muruwwa</i>), it will not be amiss to summarise the
chief points at which they clashed with each <span class="sidenote"> Antagonism of
Islamic and
Arabian ideals.</span>
other.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> In the first place, the fundamental idea of
Islam was foreign and unintelligible to the Bedouins. "It
was not the destruction of their idols that they opposed so
much as the spirit of devotion which it was sought to implant
in them: the determination of their whole lives by the
thought of God and of His pre-ordaining and retributive
omnipotence, the prayers and fasts, the renouncement of
coveted pleasures, and the sacrifice of money and property
which was demanded of them in God's name." In spite of
the saying, <i>L&aacute; d&iacute;na ill&aacute; bi &#8217;l-muruwwati</i> ("There is no
religion without virtue"), the Bedouin who accepted Islam
had to unlearn the greater part of his unwritten moral code.
As a pious Moslem he must return good for evil, forgive his
enemy, and find balm for his wounded feelings in the assurance
of being admitted to Paradise (Kor. iii, 128). Again, the
social organisation of the heathen Arabs was based on the
tribe, whereas that of Islam rested on the equality and
fraternity of all believers. The religious bond cancelled all
distinctions of rank and pedigree; it did away, theoretically,
with clannish feuds, contests for honour, pride of race&mdash;things
that lay at the very root of Arabian chivalry. "<i>Lo</i>," cried
Mu&#7717;ammad, "<i>the noblest of you in the sight of God is he who
most doth fear Him</i>" (Kor. xlix, 13). Against such doctrine
the conservative and material instincts of the desert people
rose in revolt; and although they became Moslems <i>en masse</i>,
the majority of them neither believed in Islam nor knew what
it meant. Often their motives were frankly utilitarian: they
expected that Islam would bring them luck; and so long as
they were sound in body, and their mares had fine foals, and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_179" id="Page_179" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS AND ISLAM</i></span>179</a></span>

their wives bore well-formed sons, and their wealth and herds
multiplied, they said, "We have been blessed ever since we
adopted this religion," and were content; but if things
went ill they blamed Islam and turned their backs on it.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
That these men were capable of religious zeal is amply
proved by the triumphs which they won a short time afterwards
over the disciplined armies of two mighty empires; but
what chiefly inspired them, apart from love of booty, was
the conviction, born of success, that Allah was fighting on
their side.</p>

<p class="tb">We have sketched, however barely and imperfectly, the
progress of Islam from Mu&#7717;ammad's first appearance as a
preacher to the day of his death. In these twenty years the
seeds were sown of almost every development which occurs
in the political and intellectual history of the Arabs during the
ages to come. More than any man that has ever lived,
Mu&#7717;ammad shaped the destinies of his people; and though
they left him far behind as they moved along the path of civilisation,
they still looked back to him for guidance and authority
at each step. This is not the place to attempt an estimate
of his character, which has been so diversely judged. Personally,
I feel convinced that he was neither a shameless
impostor nor a neurotic degenerate nor a socialistic reformer,
but in the beginning, at all events, a sincere religious enthusiast,
as truly inspired as any prophet of the Old Testament.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We find in him," writes De Goeje, "that sober understanding
which distinguished his fellow-tribesmen: dignity, tact, and equilibrium;
<span class="sidenote"> Character of
Mu&#7717;ammad.</span>
qualities which are seldom found in people
of morbid constitution: self-control in no small
degree. Circumstances changed him from a Prophet
to a Legislator and a Ruler, but for himself he sought nothing beyond
the acknowledgment that he was Allah's Apostle, since this acknowledgment

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_180" id="Page_180" href="#"><span><i>THE PROPHET AND THE KORAN</i></span>180</a></span>

includes the whole of Islam. He was excitable, like
every true Arab, and in the spiritual struggle which preceded his
call this quality was stimulated to an extent that alarmed even himself;
but that does not make him a visionary. He defends himself,
by the most solemn asseveration, against the charge that what
he had seen was an illusion of the senses. Why should not we
believe him?"<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p></div>

<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>

<h5>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE AND THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</h5>

<p>The Caliphate&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the period of the Caliphs or Successors of
Mu&#7717;ammad&mdash;extends over six centuries and a quarter (632-1258
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and falls into three clearly-marked divisions of
very unequal length and diverse character.</p>

<p>The first division begins with the election of Ab&uacute; Bakr, the
first Caliph, in 632, and comes to an end with the assassination
<span class="sidenote">The Orthodox
Caliphate (632-661
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
of &#8216;Al&iacute;, the Prophet's son-in-law and fourth
successor, in 661. These four Caliphs are known
as the Orthodox (<i>al-R&aacute;shid&uacute;n</i>), because they trod
faithfully in the footsteps of the Prophet and ruled after his
example in the holy city of Med&iacute;na, with the assistance of his
leading Companions, who constituted an informal Senate.</p>

<p>The second division includes the Caliphs of the family of
Umayya, from the accession of Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya in 661 to the great
<span class="sidenote">The Ummayyad
Caliphate (661-750
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
battle of the Z&aacute;b in 750, when Marw&aacute;n II, the
last of his line, was defeated by the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids,
who claimed the Caliphate as next of kin to the
Prophet. According to Moslem notions the Umayyads were
kings by right, Caliphs only by courtesy. They had, as we
shall see, no spiritual title, and little enough religion of any
sort. This dynasty, which had been raised and was upheld by
the Syrian Arabs, transferred the seat of government from
Med&iacute;na to Damascus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_182" id="Page_182" href="#"><span><i>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE</i></span>182</a></span>

The third division is by far the longest and most important.
Starting in 750 with the accession of Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s al-Saff&aacute;h,
<span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
Caliphate (750-1258
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
it presents an unbroken series of thirty-seven
Caliphs of the same House, and culminates, after
the lapse of half a millennium, in the sack of
Baghd&aacute;d, their magnificent capital, by the Mongol H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;
(January, 1258). The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids were no less despotic than
the Umayyads, but in a more enlightened fashion; for, while
the latter had been purely Arab in feeling, the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids
owed their throne to the Persian nationalists, and were
imbued with Persian ideas, which introduced a new and
fruitful element into Moslem civilisation.</p>

<p>From our special point of view the Orthodox and Umayyad
Caliphates, which form the subject of the present chapter, are
somewhat barren. The simple life of the pagan Arabs found
full expression in their poetry. The many-sided life of the
Moslems under &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid rule may be studied in a copious
literature which exhibits all the characteristics of the age; but
of contemporary documents illustrating the intellectual
history of the early Islamic period comparatively <span class="sidenote"> Early Islamic
literature.</span>
little has been preserved, and that little,
being for the most part anti-Islamic in tendency, gives only
meagre information concerning what excites interest beyond
anything else&mdash;the religious movement, the rise of theology,
and the origin of those great parties and sects which emerge,
at various stages of development, in later literature.</p>

<p>Since the Moslem Church and State are essentially one,
it is impossible to treat of politics apart from religion, nor can
<span class="sidenote"> Unity of Church
and State.</span>
religious phenomena be understood without continual
reference to political events. The following
brief sketch of the Orthodox Caliphate will
show how completely this unity was realised, and what far-reaching
consequences it had.</p>

<p>That Mu&#7717;ammad left no son was perhaps of less moment
than his neglect or refusal to nominate a successor. The

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_183" id="Page_183" href="#"><span><i>AB&Uacute; BAKR</i></span>183</a></span>

Arabs were unfamiliar with the hereditary descent of kingly
power, while the idea had not yet dawned of a Divine right
resident in the Prophet's family. It was thoroughly in accord
with Arabian practice that the Moslem community should
elect its own leader, just as in heathen days the tribe chose its
own chief. The likeliest men&mdash;all three belonged to Quraysh&mdash;were
Ab&uacute; Bakr, whose daughter &#8216;&Aacute;&#8217;isha
had been Mu&#7717;ammad's
favourite wife, &#8216;Umar b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b, and &#8216;Al&iacute;, Ab&uacute;
&#7788;&aacute;lib's son and F&aacute;&#7789;ima's husband, who was thus connected
with the Prophet by blood as well as by marriage. Ab&uacute; Bakr
was the eldest, he was supported by &#8216;Umar, and <span class="sidenote">Ab&uacute; Bakr
elected Caliph
(June, 632 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
on him the choice ultimately fell, though not
without an ominous ebullition of party strife. A
man of simple tastes and unassuming demeanour, he had earned
the name <i>al-&#7778;idd&iacute;q</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the True, by his unquestioning faith
in the Prophet; naturally gentle and merciful, he stood firm
when the cause of Islam was at stake, and crushed with iron
hand the revolt which on the news of Mu&#7717;ammad's death
spread like wildfire through Arabia. False prophets arose, and
the Bedouins rallied round them, eager to throw off the burden
of tithes and prayers. In the centre of the peninsula,
the Ban&uacute; &#7716;an&iacute;fa were led to battle by <span class="sidenote"> Musaylima the
Liar.</span>
Musaylima, who imitated the early style of the
Koran with ludicrous effect, if we may judge from the sayings
ascribed to him, <i>e.g.</i>, "The elephant, what is the elephant, and
who shall tell you what is the elephant? He has a poor tail,
and a long trunk: and is a trifling part of the creations of thy
God." Moslem tradition calls him the Liar (<i>al-Kadhdh&aacute;b</i>), and
represents him as an obscene miracle-monger, which can hardly
be the whole truth. It is possible that he got some of his
doctrines from Christianity, as Professor Margoliouth has suggested,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>
but we know too little about them to arrive at any
conclusion. After a desperate struggle Musaylima was defeated

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_184" id="Page_184" href="#"><span><i>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE</i></span>184</a></span>

and slain by 'the Sword of Allah,' Kh&aacute;lid b. Wal&iacute;d. The
Moslem arms were everywhere victorious. Arabia bowed
in sullen submission.</p>

<p>Although Muir and other biographers of Mu&#7717;ammad have
argued that Islam was originally designed for the Arabs alone,
<span class="sidenote"> Islam a world-religion.</span>
and made no claim to universal acceptance, their
assertion is contradicted by the unequivocal testimony
of the Koran itself. In one of the oldest
Revelations (lxviii, 51-52), we read: "<i>It wanteth little but that
the unbelievers dash thee to the ground with their looks</i> (of anger)
<i>when they hear the Warning</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the Koran); <i>and they say,
'He is assuredly mad': but it</i> (the Koran) <i>is no other than a</i>
<span class="smcap">Warning unto all creatures</span>" (<i>dhikr<sup>un</sup> li &#8217;l-&#8216;&aacute;lam&iacute;n</i>).<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> The
time had now come when this splendid dream was to be, in
large measure, fulfilled. The great wars of <span class="sidenote">Conquest of
Persia and Syria
(633-643 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
conquest were inspired by the Prophet's missionary
zeal and justified by his example. Pious
duty coincided with reasons of state. "It was certainly good
policy to turn the recently subdued tribes of the wilderness
towards an external aim in which they might at once satisfy

feeling, and strengthen themselves in their attachment to the
new faith."<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> The story of their achievements cannot be set
down here. Suffice it to say that within twelve years after
the Prophet's death the Persian Empire had been reduced to a
tributary province, and Syria, together with Egypt, torn away
from Byzantine rule. It must not be supposed that the followers
of Zoroaster and Christ in these countries <span class="sidenote"> Moslem toleration.</span>
were forcibly converted to Islam. Thousands
embraced it of free will, impelled by various
motives which we have no space to enumerate; those who
clung to the religion in which they had been brought up

<p>The tide of foreign conquest, which had scarce begun to
flow before the death of Ab&uacute; Bakr, swept with amazing

&#8216;Umar (634-644

rapidity over Syria and Persia in the Caliphate of
&#8216;Umar b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b (634-644), and continued to
advance, though with diminished fury, under the
Prophet's third successor, &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n. We may dwell for a little
on the noble figure of &#8216;Umar, who was regarded by good
Moslems in after times as an embodiment of all the virtues
which a Caliph ought to possess. Probably his character has
been idealised, but in any case the anecdotes related of him
give an admirable picture of the man and his age. Here are
a few, taken almost at random from the pages of &#7788;abar&iacute;.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One said: "I saw &#8216;Umar coming to the Festival. He walked
with bare feet, using both hands (for he was ambidextrous) to draw
round him a red embroidered cloth. He towered above the people,
as though he were on horseback."<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> A client of (the Caliph)
&#8216;Uthm&aacute;n b. &#8216;Aff&aacute;n relates that he mounted behind his patron and
they rode together to the enclosure for the beasts which were
delivered in payment of the poor-tax. It was an <span class="sidenote"> His simple
manners.</span>
exceedingly hot day and the simoom was blowing
fiercely. They saw a man clad only in a loin-cloth
and a short cloak (<i>rid&aacute;</i>), in which he had wrapped his head,
driving the camels into the enclosure. &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n said to his
companion, "Who is this, think you?" When they came up
to him, behold, it was &#8216;Umar b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b. "By God," said
&#8216;Uthm&aacute;n, "this is <i>the strong, the trusty</i>."<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>&mdash;&#8216;Umar used to go
round the markets and recite the Koran and judge between
disputants wherever he found them.&mdash;When Ka&#8216;bu &#8217;l-A&#7717;b&aacute;r, a
well-known Rabbin of Med&iacute;na, asked how he could obtain access
to the Commander of the Faithful,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> he received this answer: "There

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_186" id="Page_186" href="#"><span><i>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE</i></span>186</a></span>

is no door nor curtain to be passed; he performs the rites of prayer,
then he takes his seat, and any one that wishes may speak to him."<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
&#8216;Umar said in one of his public orations, "By Him who sent
Mu&#7717;ammad with the truth, were a single camel to die <span class="sidenote"> His sense of
personal
responsibility.</span>
of neglect on the bank of the Euphrates, I should fear
lest God should call the family of al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b" (meaning
himself) "to account therefor."<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>&mdash;"If I live," he is reported to have
said on another occasion, "please God, I will assuredly spend a
whole year in travelling among my subjects, for I know they have
wants which are cut short ere they reach my ears: the governors
do not bring the wants of the people before me, while the
people themselves do not attain to me. So I will journey
to Syria and remain there two months, then to Mesopotamia and
remain there two months, then to Egypt and remain there two
months, then to Ba&#7717;rayn and remain there two months, then to
K&uacute;fa and remain there two months, then to Ba&#7779;ra and remain there
two months; and by God, it will be a year well spent!"<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>&mdash;One
night he came to the house of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n b. &#8216;Awf and knocked
at the door, which was opened by &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n's wife. "Do
not enter," said she, "until I go back and sit in my place;" so he
waited. Then she bade him come in, and on his asking, "Have
you anything in the house?" she fetched him some food. Meanwhile
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n was standing by, engaged in prayer. "Be
quick, man!" cried &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n immediately pronounced
the final salaam, and turning to the Caliph said: "O Commander
of the Faithful, what has brought you here at this hour?"
&#8216;Umar replied: "A party of travellers who alighted in the neighbourhood
of the market: I was afraid that the thieves <span class="sidenote"> The Caliph as a
policeman.</span>
of Med&iacute;na might fall upon them. Let us go and keep
watch." So he set off with &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n, and
when they reached the market-place they seated themselves on
some high ground and began to converse. Presently they descried,
far away, the light of a lamp. "Have not I forbidden lamps after
bedtime?"<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> exclaimed the Caliph. They went to the spot and
found a company drinking wine. "Begone," said &#8216;Umar to &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n; "I know him." Next morning he sent for the culprit
and said, addressing him by name, "Last night you were drinking
wine with your friends." "O Commander of the Faithful, how did

you ascertain that?" "I saw it with my own eyes." "Has not God
forbidden you to play the spy?" &#8216;Umar made no answer and
pardoned his offence.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a>&mdash;When &#8216;Umar ascended the pulpit for the
purpose of warning the people that they must not do something, he
gathered his family and said to them: "I have forbidden <span class="sidenote">Instructions to
his governors.</span>
the people to do so-and-so. Now, the people
look at you as birds look at flesh, and I swear
by God that if I find any one of you doing this thing, I will
double the penalty against him."<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>&mdash;Whenever he appointed a
governor he used to draw up in writing a certificate of investiture,
which he caused to be witnessed by some of the <span class="sidenote"> His strictness
towards his own
family.</span>
Emigrants or Helpers. It contained the following
instructions: That he must not ride on horseback, nor
eat white bread, nor wear fine clothes, nor set up a door between
himself and those who had aught to ask of him.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>&mdash;It was &#8216;Umar's
custom to go forth with his governors, on their appointment, to bid
them farewell. "I have not appointed you," he would say, "over
the people of Mu&#7717;ammad (God bless him and grant him peace!)
that you may drag them by their hair and scourge their skins, but
in order that you may lead them in prayer and judge between them
with right and divide (the public money) amongst them with equity.
I have not made you lords of their skin and hair. Do not flog the
Arabs lest you humiliate them, and do not keep them long on foreign
service lest you tempt them to sedition, and do not neglect them
lest you render them desperate. Confine yourselves to the Koran,
write few Traditions of Mu&#7717;ammad (God bless him and grant him
peace!), and I am your ally." He used to permit retaliation against
his governors. On receiving a complaint about any one of them he
confronted him with the accuser, and punished him if his guilt were
proved.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p></div>

<p>It was &#8216;Umar who first made a Register (<i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i>) of the
<span class="sidenote">The Register of
&#8216;Umar.</span>
Arabs in Islam and entered them therein according
to their tribes and assigned to them their
stipends. The following account of its institution is extracted
from the charming history entitled <i>al-Fakhr&iacute;</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the fifteenth year of the Hijra (636 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) &#8216;Umar, who was then
Caliph, seeing that the conquests proceeded without interruption

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_188" id="Page_188" href="#"><span><i>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE</i></span>188</a></span>

and that the treasures of the Persian monarchs had been taken as
spoil, and that load after load was being accumulated of gold and
silver and precious jewels and splendid raiment, resolved to enrich
the Moslems by distributing all this wealth amongst them; but he
did not know how he should manage it. Now there was a Persian
satrap (<i>marzub&aacute;n</i>) at Med&iacute;na who, when he saw &#8216;Umar's bewilderment,
said to him, "O Commander of the Faithful, the Persian kings
have a thing they call a <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i>, in which is kept the whole of their
revenues and expenditures without exception; and therein those
who receive stipends are arranged in classes, so that no confusion
occurs." &#8216;Umar's attention was aroused. He bade the satrap
describe it, and on comprehending its nature, he drew up the
registers and assigned the stipends, appointing a specified allowance
for every Moslem; and he allotted fixed sums to the wives of
the Apostle (on whom be God's blessing and peace!) and to his
concubines and next-of-kin, until he exhausted the money in hand.
He did not lay up a store in the treasury. Some one came to him
and said: "O Commander of the Faithful, you should have left
something to provide for contingencies." &#8216;Umar rebuked him, saying,
"The devil has put these words into your mouth. May God
preserve me from their mischief! for it were a temptation to my
successors. Come what may, I will provide naught except obedience
to God and His Apostle. That is our provision, whereby we have
gained that which we have gained." Then, in respect of the
stipends, he deemed it right that precedence should be according
to priority of conversion to Islam and of service rendered to the
Apostle on his fields of battle.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>Affinity to Mu&#7717;ammad was also considered. "By God,"
exclaimed &#8216;Umar, "we have not won superiority in this world,
<span class="sidenote"> The aristocracy
of Islam.</span>
nor do we hope for recompense for our works from
God hereafter, save through Mu&#7717;ammad (God bless
him and grant him peace!). He is our title to
nobility, his tribe are the noblest of the Arabs, and after them
those are the nobler that are nearer to him in blood. Truly,
the Arabs are ennobled by God's Apostle. Peradventure some
of them have many ancestors in common with him, and we
ourselves are only removed by a few forbears from his line of
descent, in which we accompany him back to Adam. Notwithstanding
<span class="sidenote"> "'Tis only noble
to be good."</span>
this, if the foreigners bring good works and
we bring none, by God, they are nearer to Mu&#7717;ammad
on the day of Resurrection than we. Therefore let no
man regard affinity, but let him work for that which is in God's

by his lineage."<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p></div>

<p>It may be said of &#8216;Umar, not less appropriately than of
Cromwell, that he</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">
"cast the kingdoms old</span><span class="i0">
Into another mould;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>and he too justified the poet's maxim&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"The same arts that did gain</span><span class="i0">
A power, must it maintain."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Under the system which he organised Arabia, purged of
infidels, became a vast recruiting-ground for the standing
armies of Islam: the Arabs in the conquered territories formed
an exclusive military class, living in great camps and supported
by revenues derived from the non-Mu&#7717;ammadan population.
Out of such camps arose two cities destined to make their
<span class="sidenote">Foundation of
Ba&#7779;ra and K&uacute;fa
(638 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
mark in literary history&mdash;Ba&#7779;ra (Bassora) on the
delta of the Tigris and Euphrates, and K&uacute;fa,
which was founded about the same time on the
western branch of the latter stream, not far from &#7716;&iacute;ra.</p>

<p>&#8216;Umar was murdered by a Persian slave named F&iacute;r&uacute;z while
leading the prayers in the Great Mosque. With <span class="sidenote">Death of &#8216;Umar
(644 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
his death the military theocracy and the palmy
days of the Patriarchal Caliphate draw to a close. The broad
lines of his character appear in the anecdotes translated above,
though many details might be added to complete the picture.
Simple and frugal; doing his duty without fear or favour;
energetic even to harshness, yet capable of tenderness towards
the weak; a severe judge of others and especially of himself,
he was a born ruler and every inch a man. Looking back on

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_190" id="Page_190" href="#"><span><i>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE</i></span>190</a></span>

the turmoils which followed his death one is inclined to agree
with the opinion of a saintly doctor who said, five centuries
afterwards, that "the good fortune of Islam was shrouded in
the grave-clothes of &#8216;Umar b. al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b."<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>When the Meccan aristocrats accepted Islam, they only
yielded to the inevitable. They were now to have an opportunity
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Uthm&aacute;n elected
Caliph (644 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
of revenging themselves. &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n b.
&#8216;Aff&aacute;n, who succeeded &#8216;Umar as Caliph, belonged
to a distinguished Meccan family, the Umayyads or
descendants of Umayya, which had always taken a leading part
in the opposition to Mu&#7717;ammad, though &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n himself was
among the Prophet's first disciples. He was a pious, well-meaning
old man&mdash;an easy tool in the hands of his ambitious
kinsfolk. They soon climbed into all the most lucrative and
important offices and lived on the fat of the land, while too
often their ungodly behaviour gave point to the question whether
these converts of the eleventh hour were not still heathens at
heart. Other causes contributed to excite a general <span class="sidenote"> General disaffection.</span>
discontent. The rapid growth of luxury and
immorality in the Holy Cities as well as in the
new settlements was an eyesore to devout Moslems. The
true Islamic aristocracy, the Companions of the Prophet, headed
by &#8216;Al&iacute;, &#7788;al&#7717;a, and Zubayr, strove to undermine the rival
nobility which threatened them with destruction. The
factious soldiery were ripe for revolt against Umayyad arrogance
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Uthm&aacute;n murdered
(656 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
and greed. Rebellion broke out, and finally the
aged Caliph, after enduring a siege of several
weeks, was murdered in his own house. This event marks an
epoch in the history of the Arabs. The ensuing civil wars
rent the unity of Islam from top to bottom, and the wound
has never healed.</p>

<p class="tb">&#8216;Al&iacute;, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, who had hitherto

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_191" id="Page_191" href="#"><span><i>&#8216;UTHM&Aacute;N AND &#8216;AL&Iacute;</i></span>191</a></span>

remained in the background, was now made Caliph. Although
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Al&iacute; elected
Caliph (656 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
the suspicion that he was in league with the
murderers may be put aside, he showed culpable
weakness in leaving &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n to his fate
without an effort to save him. But &#8216;Al&iacute; had
almost every virtue except those of the ruler: energy,
decision, and foresight. He was a gallant warrior, a wise
counsellor, a true friend, and a generous foe. <span class="sidenote">Character of
&#8216;Al&iacute;.</span>
He excelled in poetry and in eloquence; his
verses and sayings are famous throughout the
Mu&#7717;ammadan East, though few of them can be considered
authentic. A fine spirit worthy to be compared with
Montrose and Bayard, he had no talent for the stern
realities of statecraft, and was overmatched by unscrupulous
rivals who knew that "war is a game of deceit." Thus
his career was in one sense a failure: his authority as
Caliph was never admitted, while he lived, by the whole
community. On the other hand, he has exerted, down to
the present day, a posthumous influence only <span class="sidenote"> His apotheosis.</span>
second to that of Mu&#7717;ammad himself. Within
a century of his death he came to be regarded as the
Prophet's successor <i>jure divino</i>; as a blessed martyr, sinless
and infallible; and by some even as an incarnation of God.
The &#8216;Al&iacute; of Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite legend is not an historical figure glorified:
rather does he symbolise, in purely mythical fashion,
the religious aspirations and political aims of a large section
of the Moslem world.</p>

<p class="tb">To return to our narrative. No sooner was &#8216;Al&iacute; proclaimed
Caliph by the victorious rebels than Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya b.
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Al&iacute; against
Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya.</span>
Ab&iacute; Sufy&aacute;n, the governor of Syria, raised the
cry of vengeance for &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n and refused to
take the oath of allegiance. As head of the
Umayyad family, Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya might justly demand that the
murderers of his kinsman should be punished, but the contest

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_192" id="Page_192" href="#"><span><i>THE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE</i></span>192</a></span>

between him and &#8216;Al&iacute; was virtually for the Caliphate.
A great battle was fought at &#7778;iff&iacute;n, a village on the
Euphrates. &#8216;Al&iacute; had well-nigh gained the day <span class="sidenote">Battle of &#7778;iff&iacute;n
(657 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
when Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya bethought him of a stratagem.
He ordered his troops to fix Korans on the
points of their lances and to shout, "Here is the Book of
God: let it decide between us!" The miserable trick
succeeded. In &#8216;Al&iacute;'s army there were many pious fanatics
to whom the proposed arbitration by the Koran appealed
with irresistible force. They now sprang forward
clamorously, threatening to betray their leader unless he
would submit his cause to the Book. Vainly did &#8216;Al&iacute;
remonstrate with the mutineers, and warn them of the
trap into which they were driving him, and this too at
the moment when victory was within their grasp. He <span class="sidenote"> Arbitration.</span>
had no choice but to yield and name as his
umpire a man of doubtful loyalty, Ab&uacute; M&uacute;s&aacute;
al-Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, one of the oldest surviving Companions of the
Prophet. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya on his part named &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;&Aacute;&#7779;,
whose cunning had prompted the decisive man&oelig;uvre.
When the umpires came forth to give judgment, Ab&uacute;
M&uacute;s&aacute; rose and in accordance with what had been arranged
at the preliminary conference pronounced that both &#8216;Al&iacute;
and Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya should be deposed and that the <span class="sidenote"> The award.</span>
people should elect a proper Caliph in their
stead. "Lo," said he, laying down his sword, "even thus
do I depose &#8216;Al&iacute; b. Ab&iacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib." Then &#8216;Amr advanced and
spoke as follows: "O people! ye have heard the judgment
of my colleague. He has called you to witness that he
deposes &#8216;Al&iacute;. Now I call you to witness that I confirm
Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, even as I make fast this sword of mine," and
suiting the action to the word, he returned it to its sheath.
It is characteristic of Arabian notions of morality that this
impudent fraud was hailed by Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's adherents as a
diplomatic triumph which gave him a colourable pretext

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_193" id="Page_193" href="#"><span><i>CIVIL WAR</i></span>193</a></span>

for assuming the title of Caliph. Both sides prepared to
renew the struggle, but in the meanwhile &#8216;Al&iacute; found his
hands full nearer home. A numerous party among his
troops, including the same zealots who had forced arbitration
upon him, now cast him off because he had accepted <span class="sidenote">The Kh&aacute;rijites
revolt against
&#8216;Al&iacute;.</span>
it, fell out from the ranks, and raised the
standard of revolt. These 'Outgoers,' or
Kh&aacute;rijites, as they were called, maintained
their theocratic principles with desperate courage, and
though often defeated took the field again and again.
&#8216;Al&iacute;'s plans for recovering Syria were finally abandoned
<span class="sidenote">Al&iacute; assassinated
(661 <span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>).</span>
in 660, when he concluded peace with
Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, and shortly afterwards he was struck
down in the Mosque at K&uacute;fa, which he had
made his capital, by Ibn Muljam, a Kh&aacute;rijite conspirator.</p>

<p>With &#8216;Al&iacute;'s fall our sketch of the Orthodox Caliphate
may fitly end. It was necessary to give some account of
these years so vital in the history of Islam, even at the
risk of wearying the reader, who will perhaps wish that
less space were devoted to political affairs.</p>

<p class="tb">The Umayyads came into power, but, except in Syria and
Egypt, they ruled solely by the sword. As descendants and
representatives of the pagan aristocracy, which <span class="sidenote"> The Umayyad
dynasty.</span>
strove with all its might to defeat Mu&#7717;ammad,
they were usurpers in the eyes of the Moslem
community which they claimed to lead as his successors.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>
We shall see, a little further on, how this opposition expressed
itself in two great parties: the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites or followers
of &#8216;Al&iacute;, and the radical sect of the Kh&aacute;rijites, who have
been mentioned above; and how it was gradually reinforced
by the non-Arabian Moslems until it overwhelmed

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_194" id="Page_194" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>194</a></span>

the Umayyad Government and set up the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids in their
place. In estimating the character of the Umayyads one
must bear in mind that the epitaph on the fallen <span class="sidenote"> Moslem tradition
hostile to
the Umayyads.</span>
dynasty was composed by their enemies, and can
no more be considered historically truthful than
the lurid picture which Tacitus has drawn of the Emperor
Tiberius. Because they kept the revolutionary forces in
check with ruthless severity, the Umayyads pass for bloodthirsty
tyrants; whereas the best of them at any rate were
strong and singularly capable rulers, bad Moslems and good
men of the world, seldom cruel, plain livers if not high
thinkers; who upon the whole stand as much above the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sids in morality as below them in culture and intellect.
Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's clemency was proverbial, though he too
could be stern on occasion. When members of the house
of &#8216;Al&iacute; came to visit him at Damascus, which was now
the capital of the Mu&#7717;ammadan Empire, he gave them
honourable lodging and entertainment and was anxious to
do what they asked; but they (relates the historian <span class="sidenote">Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's
clemency.</span>
approvingly) used to address him in the
rudest terms and affront him in the vilest
manner: sometimes he would answer them with a jest, and
another time he would feign not to hear, and he always
dismissed them with splendid presents and ample donations.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>
"I do not employ my sword," he said, "when my whip
suffices me, nor my whip when my tongue suffices me; and
were there but a single hair (of friendship) between me and
my subjects, I would not let it be snapped."<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> After the

<p>Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's chief henchman was Ziy&aacute;d, the son of Sumayya
(Sumayya being the name of his mother), or, as he is generally
<span class="sidenote"> Ziy&aacute;d ibn
Ab&iacute;hi.</span>
called, Ziy&aacute;d ibn Ab&iacute;hi, <i>i.e.</i>, 'Ziy&aacute;d his father's
son,' for none knew who was his sire, though
rumour pointed to Ab&uacute; Sufy&aacute;n; in which case
Ziy&aacute;d would have been Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's half-brother. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya,
instead of disavowing the scandalous imputation, acknowledged
him as such, and made him governor of Ba&#7779;ra, where he ruled
the Eastern provinces with a rod of iron.</p>

<p>Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya was a crafty diplomatist&mdash;he has been well compared
to Richelieu&mdash;whose profound knowledge of human
nature enabled him to gain over men of moderate opinions in
all the parties opposed to him. Events were soon to prove the
hollowness of this outward reconciliation. Yaz&iacute;d, who succeeded
his father, was the son of Mays&uacute;n, a <span class="sidenote">Yaz&iacute;d
(680-683 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Bedouin woman whom Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya married before he
rose to be Caliph. The luxury of Damascus had
no charm for her wild spirit, and she gave utterance to her
feeling of homesickness in melancholy verse:&mdash;</p>

Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, annoyed by the contemptuous allusion to himself,
took the dame at her word. She returned to her own
family, and Yaz&iacute;d grew up as a Bedouin, with the instincts
and tastes which belong to the Bedouins&mdash;love of pleasure,
hatred of piety, and reckless disregard for the laws of religion.
The beginning of his reign was marked by an event of
which even now few Moslems can speak without a thrill
of horror and dismay. The facts are briefly these: In the
autumn of the year 680 &#7716;usayn, the son of &#8216;Al&iacute;, claiming
to be the rightful Caliph in virtue of his descent from the
Prophet, quitted Mecca with his whole family and a number
of devoted friends, and set out for K&uacute;fa, where he expected
the population, which was almost entirely Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite, to rally
to his cause. It was a foolhardy adventure. <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;usayn
marches on
K&uacute;fa.</span>
The poet Farazdaq, who knew the fickle temper
of his fellow-townsmen, told &#7716;usayn that
although their hearts were with him, their swords would be
with the Umayyads; but his warning was given in vain.
Meanwhile &#8216;Ubaydull&aacute;h b. Ziy&aacute;d, the governor of K&uacute;fa,
having overawed the insurgents in the city and beheaded
their leader, Muslim b. &#8216;Aq&iacute;l, who was a cousin of &#7716;usayn,
sent a force of cavalry with orders to bring the arch-rebel
to a stand. Retreat was still open to him. But his followers
cried out that the blood of Muslim must be avenged, and
&#7716;usayn could not hesitate. Turning northward along the
Euphrates, he encamped at Karbal&aacute; with his little band,
which, including the women and children, amounted to
some two hundred souls. In this hopeless situation he
offered terms which might have been accepted if Shamir b.
Dhi &#8217;l-Jawshan, a name for ever infamous and accursed, had
not persuaded &#8216;Ubaydull&aacute;h to insist on unconditional surrender.
The demand was refused, and &#7716;usayn drew up
his comrades&mdash;a handful of men and boys&mdash;for battle
against the host which surrounded them. All the harrowing
details invented by grief and passion can scarcely

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_197" id="Page_197" href="#"><span><i>BATTLE OF KARBALA</i></span>197</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Massacre of
&#7716;usayn and his

heighten the tragedy of the closing scene. It would appear
that the Umayyad officers themselves shrank from the
odium of a general massacre, and hoped to
take the Prophet's grandson alive. Shamir,
however, had no such scruples. Chafing at
delay, he urged his soldiers to the assault. The
unequal struggle was soon over. &#7716;usayn fell,
pierced by an arrow, and his brave followers
were cut down beside him to the last man.</p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammadan tradition, which with rare exceptions is
uniformly hostile to the Umayyad dynasty, regards &#7716;usayn
<span class="sidenote"> Differing views
of Mu&#7717;ammadan
and European
writers.</span>
as a martyr and Yaz&iacute;d as his murderer; while
modern historians, for the most part, agree with
Sir W. Muir, who points out that &#7716;usayn,
"having yielded himself to a treasonable, though
impotent design upon the throne, was committing an
offence that endangered society and demanded swift suppression."
This was naturally the view of the party in power,
and the reader must form his own conclusion as to how
far it justifies the action which they took. For Moslems
the question is decided by the relation of the Umayyads to
Islam. Violators of its laws and spurners of its <span class="sidenote"> The Umayyads
judged
by Islam.</span>
ideals, they could never be anything but tyrants;
and being tyrants, they had no right to slay
believers who rose in arms against their usurped authority.
The so-called verdict of history, when we come to examine
it, is seen to be the verdict of religion, the judgment of
theocratic Islam on Arabian Imperialism. On this ground
the Umayyads are justly condemned, but it is well to remember
that in Moslem eyes the distinction between <span class="sidenote"> Character of
Yaz&iacute;d.</span>
Church and State does not exist. Yaz&iacute;d was a
bad Churchman: therefore he was a wicked
tyrant; the one thing involves the other.
From our unprejudiced standpoint, he was an amiable
prince who inherited his mother's poetic talent, and infinitely

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_198" id="Page_198" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>198</a></span>

preferred wine, music, and sport to the drudgery
of public affairs. The Syrian Arabs, who recognised the
Umayyads as legitimate, thought highly of him: "Jucundissimus,"
says a Christian writer, "et cunctis nationibus
regni ejus subditis vir gratissime habitus, qui nullam unquam,
ut omnibus moris est, sibi regalis fastigii causa gloriam
appetivit, sed communis cum omnibus civiliter vixit."<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> He
deplored the fate of the women and children of &#7716;usayn's
family, treated them with every mark of respect, and sent
them to Med&iacute;na, where their account of the tragedy added
fresh fuel to the hatred and indignation with which its
authors were generally regarded.</p>

<p>The Umayyads had indeed ample cause to rue the day
of Karbal&aacute;. It gave the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite faction a rallying-cry&mdash;"Vengeance
for &#7716;usayn!"&mdash;which was taken up on all
sides, and especially by the Persian <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>, or Clients, who
longed for deliverance from the Arab yoke. Their amalgamation
with the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a&mdash;a few years later they flocked in
thousands to the standard of Mukht&aacute;r&mdash;was an event of
the utmost historical importance, which will be discussed
when we come to speak of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites in particular.</p>

<p class="tb">The slaughter of &#7716;usayn does not complete the tale of
Yaz&iacute;d's enormities. Med&iacute;na, the Prophet's city, having
<span class="sidenote">Med&iacute;na and
Mecca
desecrated
(682-3 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
expelled its Umayyad governor, was sacked by
a Syrian army, while Mecca itself, where
&#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Zubayr had set up as rival Caliph,
was besieged, and the Ka&#8216;ba laid in ruins. These
outrages, shocking to Moslem sentiment, kindled a flame of
rebellion. &#7716;usayn was avenged by Mukht&aacute;r, <span class="sidenote">Rebellion of
Mukht&aacute;r
(685-6 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
who seized K&uacute;fa and executed some three hundred
of the guilty citizens, including the miscreant
Shamir. His troops defeated and slew &#8216;Ubaydull&aacute;h b.
Ziy&aacute;d, but he himself was slain, not long afterwards, by

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_199" id="Page_199" href="#"><span><i>YAZ&Iacute;D</i></span>199</a></span>

Mus&#8216;ab, the brother of Ibn Zubayr, and seven thousand of
his followers were massacred in cold blood. On Yaz&iacute;d's
death (683) the Umayyad Empire threatened to fall to
pieces. As a contemporary poet sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Now loathed of all men is the Fury blind</span><span class="i0">
Which blazeth as a fire blown by the wind.</span><span class="i0">

Commander of the Faithful, each its throne."<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fierce dissensions broke out among the Syrian Arabs, the
backbone of the dynasty. The great tribal groups of Kalb and
<span class="sidenote"> Civil war
renewed.</span>
Qays, whose coalition had hitherto maintained
the Umayyads in power, fought on opposite sides
at Marj R&aacute;hi&#7789; (684), the former for Marw&aacute;n and
the latter for Ibn Zubayr. Marw&aacute;n's victory secured the
allegiance of Syria, but henceforth Qays and Kalb were
always at daggers drawn.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> This was essentially a feud between
the Northern and the Southern Arabs&mdash;a feud which rapidly
extended and developed into a permanent racial enmity.
They carried it with them to the farthest ends <span class="sidenote"> Rivalry of
Northern and
Southern Arabs.</span>
of the world, so that, for example, after the
conquest of Spain precautions had to be taken
against civil war by providing that Northerners and Southerners
should not settle in the same districts. The literary history of
this antagonism has been sketched by Dr. Goldziher with his
wonted erudition and acumen.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> Satire was, of course, the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_200" id="Page_200" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>200</a></span>

principal weapon of both sides. Here is a fragment by a
Northern poet which belongs to the Umayyad period:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Negroes are better, when they name their sires,</span><span class="i0">
Than Qa&#7717;&#7789;&aacute;n's sons,<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> the uncircumcis&egrave;d cowards:</span><span class="i0">

Their clients spoil for cavaliers and footmen."<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the Arab nation was again torn asunder by the old
tribal pretensions which Mu&#7717;ammad sought to abolish. That
they ultimately proved fatal to the Umayyads is no matter for
surprise; the sorely pressed dynasty was already tottering, its
enemies were at its gates. By good fortune it produced at
this crisis an exceptionally able and vigorous ruler, &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Malik b. Marw&aacute;n, who not only saved his house from
destruction, but re-established its supremacy and inaugurated
a more brilliant epoch than any that had gone before.</p>

<p>&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik succeeded his father in 685, but required
seven years of hard fighting to make good his claim to the
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik
and his
successors.</span>
Caliphate. When his most formidable rival, Ibn
Zubayr, had fallen in battle (692), the eastern
provinces were still overrun by rebels, who offered
a desperate resistance to the governor of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, the iron-handed
&#7716;ajj&aacute;j. But enough of bloodshed. Peace also had
her victories during the troubled reign of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik and
the calmer sway of his successors. Four of the next five
Caliphs were his own sons&mdash;Wal&iacute;d (705-715), Sulaym&aacute;n
(715-717), Yaz&iacute;d II (720-724), and Hish&aacute;m (724-743);
the fifth, &#8216;Umar II, was the son of his brother, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-&#8216;Az&iacute;z.
For the greater part of this time the Moslem lands enjoyed a
well-earned interval of repose and prosperity, which mitigated,
though it could not undo, the frightful devastation wrought by

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_201" id="Page_201" href="#"><span><i>&#8216;ABDU &#8217;L-MALIK</i></span>201</a></span>

twenty years of almost continuous civil war. Many reforms
were introduced, some wholly political in character, while
others inspired by the same motives have, none the less, a
direct bearing on literary history. &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik <span class="sidenote">Reforms of
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik.</span>
organised an excellent postal service, by means of
relays of horses, for the conveyance of despatches
and travellers; he substituted for the Byzantine and Persian
coins, which had hitherto been in general use, new gold and
silver pieces, on which be caused sentences from the Koran
to be engraved; and he made Arabic, instead of Greek or
Persian, the official language of financial administration.
Steps were taken, moreover, to improve the extremely
defective Arabic script, and in this way to provide a sound
basis for the study and interpretation of the Koran as well
as for the collection of <i>&#7717;ad&iacute;ths</i> or sayings of the Prophet,
which form an indispensable supplement thereto. The Arabic
alphabet, as it was then written, consisted entirely <span class="sidenote"> The writing of
Arabic.</span>
of consonants, so that, to give an illustration from
English, <i>bnd</i> might denote <i>band</i>, <i>bend</i>, <i>bind</i>, or
<i>bond</i>; <i>crt</i> might stand for <i>cart</i>, <i>carat</i>, <i>curt</i>, and so on. To
an Arab this ambiguity mattered little; far worse confusion
arose from the circumstance that many of the consonants
themselves were exactly alike: thus, <i>e.g.</i>, it was possible to
read the same combination of three letters as <i>bnt</i>, <i>nbt</i>, <i>byt</i>, <i>tnb</i>,
<i>ntb</i>, <i>nyb</i>, and in various other ways. Considering the difficulties
of the Arabic language, which are so great that a European
aided by scientific grammars and unequivocal texts will often
find himself puzzled even when he has become tolerably
familiar with it, one may imagine that the Koran was virtually
a sealed book to all but a few among the crowds of foreigners
who accepted Islam after the early conquests. &#8216;Abdu&#8217;l-Malik's
viceroy in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, the famous &#7716;ajj&aacute;j, who began life as a schoolmaster,
exerted himself to promote the use of vowel-marks
(borrowed from the Syriac) and of the diacritical points placed
above or below similar consonants. This extraordinary man

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_202" id="Page_202" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>202</a></span>

deserves more than a passing mention. A stern disciplinarian,
who could be counted upon to do his duty without any regard
to public opinion, he was chosen by &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik
to besiege Mecca, which Ibn Zubayr was holding <span class="sidenote">&#7716;ajj&aacute;j b. Y&uacute;suf
(&#8224;&nbsp;714 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
as anti-Caliph. &#7716;ajj&aacute;j bombarded the city, defeated
the Pretender, and sent his head to Damascus. Two years
afterwards he became governor of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q. Entering the
Mosque at K&uacute;fa, he mounted the pulpit and introduced
himself to the assembled townsmen in these memorable
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"I am he who scattereth the darkness and climbeth o'er the summits.</span><span class="i0">
When I lift the turban from my face, ye will know me.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>"O people of K&uacute;fa! I see heads that are ripe for cutting,
and I am the man to do it; and methinks, I see blood between
the turbans and beards."<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> The rest of his speech was in
keeping with the commencement. He used no idle threats,
as the malcontents soon found out. Rebellion, which had
been rampant before his arrival, was rapidly extinguished.
"He restored order in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q and subdued its people."<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> For
twenty years his despotic rule gave peace and security to
the Eastern world. Cruel he may have been, though the
tales of his bloodthirstiness are beyond doubt grossly exaggerated,
but it should be put to his credit that he established
and maintained the settled conditions which <span class="sidenote"> His service to
literature.</span>
afford leisure for the cultivation of learning.
Under his protection the Koran and Traditions were diligently
studied both in K&uacute;fa and Ba&#7779;ra, where many Companions of
the Prophet had made their home: hence arose in Ba&#7779;ra the
science of Grammar, with which, as we shall see in a subsequent
page, the name of that city is peculiarly associated.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_203" id="Page_203" href="#"><span><i>&#7716;AJJ&Aacute;J IBN Y&Uacute;SUF</i></span>203</a></span>

&#7716;ajj&aacute;j shared the literary tastes of his sovereign; he admired
the old poets and patronised the new; he was a master of
terse eloquence and plumed himself on his elegant Arabic
style. The most hated man of his time, he lives in history as
the savage oppressor and butcher of God-fearing Moslems.
He served the Umayyads well and faithfully, and when he
died in 714 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he left behind him nothing but his Koran, his
arms, and a few hundred pieces of silver.</p>

<p class="tb">It was a common saying at Damascus that under Wal&iacute;d

and the fair sex, while in the reign of &#8216;Umar b.
&#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Az&iacute;z the Koran and religion formed
favourite topics of conversation.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> Of Wal&iacute;d's

never learn to express himself with propriety.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> The unbroken
peace which now prevailed within the Empire enabled Wal&iacute;d

pushed forward to the Chinese frontier. Another <span class="sidenote"> Moslem

force crossed the Indus and penetrated as far as
M&uacute;lt&aacute;n, a renowned centre of pilgrimage in the
Southern Punjaub, which fell into the hands of the Moslems
after a prolonged siege. But the most brilliant advance, and
the richest in its results, was that in the extreme West, which
decided the fate of Spain. Although the Moslems had obtained
a footing in Northern Africa some thirty years before this
time, their position was always precarious, until in 709 M&uacute;s&aacute;

b. Nu&#7779;ayr completely subjugated the Berbers, and extended not
only the dominion but also the faith of Islam to the Atlantic
Ocean. Two years later his freedman &#7788;&aacute;riq <span class="sidenote">Conquest of

crossed the straits and took possession of the
commanding height, called by the ancients Calpe,
but henceforth known as Jabal &#7788;&aacute;riq (Gibraltar). Roderic,
the last of the West Gothic dynasty, gathered an army in
defence of his kingdom, but there were traitors in the camp,
and, though he himself fought valiantly, their defection turned
the fortunes of the day. The king fled, and it was never
ascertained what became of him. &#7788;&aacute;riq, meeting with feeble
resistance, marched rapidly on Toledo, while M&uacute;s&aacute;, whose
jealousy was excited by the triumphal progress of his lieutenant,
now joined in the campaign, and, storming city after
city, reached the Pyrenees. The conquest of Spain, which is
told by Moslem historians with many romantic circumstances,
marks the nearest approach that the Arabs ever made to
World-Empire. Their advance on French soil was finally
hurled back by Charles the Hammer's great victory at Tours
(732 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>Before taking leave of the Umayyads we must not forget to
mention &#8216;Umar b. &#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Az&iacute;z, a ruler who stands out in
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Umar b. &#8216;Abd
al-&#8216;Az&iacute;z
(717-720 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
singular contrast with his predecessors, and whose
brief reign is regarded by many Moslems as the
sole bright spot in a century of godless and bloodstained
tyranny. There had been nothing like it since the
days of his illustrious namesake and kinsman,<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> &#8216;Umar b.
al-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;b, and we shall find nothing like it in the future
history of the Caliphate. Plato desired that every king should
be a philosopher: according to Mu&#7717;ammadan theory every
Caliph ought to be a saint. &#8216;Umar satisfied these aspirations.
When he came to the throne the following dialogue is said to
have occurred between him and one of his favourites, S&aacute;lim
al-Sudd&iacute;:&mdash;</p>

S&aacute;lim: "I am glad for the people's sake, but sorry for yours."<br />

S&aacute;lim: "If you are afraid, very good. I only fear that you may

thronged by divines and men of ascetic life.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> He warned his
governors that they must either deal justly or go. He would
not allow political considerations to interfere with his ideal of
righteousness, but, as Wellhausen points out, he had practical
ends in view: his piety made him anxious for the common
weal no less than for his own salvation. Whether he
administered the State successfully is a matter of dispute.
It has been generally supposed that his financial reforms
were Utopian in character and disastrous to the Exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>
However this may be, he showed wisdom in seeking to bridge
the menacing chasm between Islam and the Imperial house.
Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, he did away with the custom which had long
prevailed of cursing &#8216;Al&iacute; from the pulpit at Friday prayers.
The policy of conciliation was tried too late, and for too short
a space, to be effective; but it was not entirely fruitless.
When, on the overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty, the tombs
of the hated 'tyrants' were defiled and their bodies disinterred,
&#8216;Umar's grave alone was respected, and Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;

<p>Let us now turn from the monarchs to their subjects.</p>

<p>In the first place we shall speak of the political and religious
parties, whose opposition to the Umayyad House gradually
<span class="sidenote"> Political and
religious movements
of the
period.</span>
undermined its influence and in the end brought
about its fall. Some account will be given of the
ideas for which these parties fought and of the
causes of their discontent with the existing
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>. Secondly, a few words must be said of the theological
and more purely religious sects&mdash;the Mu&#8216;tazilites, Murjites, and
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s; and, lastly, of the extant literature, which is almost
exclusively poetical, and its leading representatives.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_207" id="Page_207" href="#"><span><i>OPPOSITION PARTIES</i></span>207</a></span>

The opposition to the Umayyads was at first mainly a
question of politics. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya's accession announced the
<span class="sidenote">The Arabs of
&#8216;Ir&aacute;q.</span>
triumph of Syria over &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, and Damascus,
instead of K&uacute;fa, became the capital of the
Empire. As Wellhausen observes, "the most
powerful risings against the Umayyads proceeded from
&#8216;Ir&aacute;q, not from any special party, but from the whole mass
of the Arabs settled there, who were united in resenting the
loss of their independence (<i>Selbstherrlichkeit</i>) and in hating
those into whose hands it had passed."<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> At the same time
these feelings took a religious colour and identified themselves
with the cause of Islam. The new government fell
lamentably short of the theocratic standard by which it was
judged. Therefore it was evil, and (according to the
Moslem's conception of duty) every right-thinking man
must work for its destruction.</p>

<p>Among the myriads striving for this consummation, and so
far making common cause with each other, we can distinguish
<span class="sidenote"> Parties opposed
to the Umayyad
government.</span>
four principal classes.</p>

<p>(1) The religious Moslems, or Pietists, in
general, who formed a wing of the Orthodox
Party.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>(2) The Kh&aacute;rijites, who may be described as the Puritans
and extreme Radicals of theocracy.</p>

<p>(3) The Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, or partisans of &#8216;Al&iacute; and his House.</p>

<p>(4) The Non-Arabian Moslems, who were called <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>
(Clients).</p>

<p>It is clear that the Pietists&mdash;including divines learned in the
law, reciters of the Koran, Companions of the Prophet and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_208" id="Page_208" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>208</a></span>

their descendants&mdash;could not but abominate the secular authority
which they were now compelled to obey. The conviction
<span class="sidenote"> The Pietists.</span>
that Might, in the shape of the tyrant and
his minions, trampled on Right as represented by
the Koran and the <i>Sunna</i> (custom of Mu&#7717;ammad) drove many
into active rebellion: five thousand are said to have perished
in the sack of Med&iacute;na alone. Others again, like &#7716;asan of
Ba&#7779;ra, filled with profound despair, shut their eyes on the
world, and gave themselves up to asceticism, a tendency
which had important consequences, as we shall see.</p>

<p class="tb">When &#8216;Al&iacute;, on the field of &#7778;iffin, consented that the claims
of Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya and himself to the Caliphate should be decided
<span class="sidenote"> The Kh&aacute;rijites.</span>
by arbitration, a large section of his army accused
him of having betrayed his trust. He, the duly
elected Caliph&mdash;so they argued&mdash;should have maintained the
dignity of his high office inviolate at all costs. On the homeward
march the malcontents, some twelve thousand in number,
broke away and encamped by themselves at &#7716;ar&uacute;r&aacute;, a village
near K&uacute;fa. Their cry was, "God alone can decide" (<i>l&aacute;
&#7717;ukma ill&aacute; lill&aacute;hi</i>): in these terms they protested against the
arbitration. &#8216;Al&iacute; endeavoured to win them back, but without
any lasting success. They elected a Caliph from among themselves,
and gathered at Nahraw&aacute;n, four thousand <span class="sidenote">Battle of Nahraw&aacute;n
(658 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
strong. On the appearance of &#8216;Al&iacute; with a vastly
superior force many of the rebels dispersed, but
the remainder&mdash;about half&mdash;preferred to die for their faith.
Nahraw&aacute;n was to the Kh&aacute;rijites what Karbal&aacute; afterwards
became to the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, who from this day were regarded by
the former as their chief enemies. Frequent Kh&aacute;rijite risings
took place during the early Umayyad period, but <span class="sidenote"> Kh&aacute;rijite risings.</span>
the movement reached its zenith in the years of
confusion which followed Yaz&iacute;d's death. The Azraqites, so
called after their leader, N&aacute;fi&#8216; b. al-Azraq, overran &#8216;Ir&aacute;q and
Southern Persia, while another sect, the Najdites, led by

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_209" id="Page_209" href="#"><span><i>THE KH&Aacute;RIJITES</i></span>209</a></span>

Najda b. &#8216;&Aacute;mir, reduced the greater part of Arabia to submission.
The insurgents held their ground for a long time
against &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik, and did not cease from troubling until
the rebellion headed by Shab&iacute;b was at last stamped out by
&#7716;ajj&aacute;j in 697.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the name <i>Kh&aacute;rij&iacute;</i> (plural, <i>Khaw&aacute;rij</i>)
refers to a passage in the Koran (iv, 101) where mention is made
<span class="sidenote"> Meaning of
'Kh&aacute;rijite.'</span>
of "those who go forth (<i>yakhruj</i>) from their homes
as emigrants (<i>muh&aacute;jir<sup>an</sup></i>) to God and His Messenger";
so that 'Kh&aacute;rijite' means 'one who
leaves his home among the unbelievers for God's sake,' and
corresponds to the term <i>Muh&aacute;jir</i>, which was applied to the
Meccan converts who accompanied the Prophet in his migration
to Med&iacute;na.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> Another name by which they are often designated
is likewise Koranic in origin, viz., <i>Shur&aacute;t</i> (plural of
<i>Sh&aacute;r<sup>in</sup></i>): literally 'Sellers'&mdash;that is to say, those who sell
their lives and goods in return for Paradise.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> The Kh&aacute;rijites
were mostly drawn from the Bedouin soldiery who settled in
Ba&#7779;ra and K&uacute;fa after the Persian wars. Civil life wrought
little change in their unruly temper. Far from <span class="sidenote"> Their political
theories.</span>
acknowledging the peculiar sanctity of a
Qurayshite, they desired a chief of their own
blood whom they might obey, in Bedouin fashion, as long
as he did not abuse or exceed the powers conferred upon
him.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> The mainspring of the movement, however, was
pietistic, and can be traced, as Wellhausen has shown, to
the Koran-readers who made it a matter of conscience
that &#8216;Al&iacute; should avow his contrition for the fatal error
which their own temporary and deeply regretted infatuation
had forced him to commit. They cast off &#8216;Al&iacute; for the same

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_210" id="Page_210" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>210</a></span>

reason which led them to strike at &#8216;Uthman: in both cases
they were maintaining the cause of God against an unjust
Caliph.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> It is important to remember these facts in view of
the cardinal Kh&aacute;rijite doctrines (1) that every free Arab was
eligible as Caliph,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> and (2) that an evil-doing Caliph must be
deposed and, if necessary, put to death. Mustawrid b. &#8216;Ullifa,
the Kh&aacute;rijite 'Commander of the Faithful,' wrote to Sim&aacute;k
b. &#8216;Ubayd, the governor of Ctesiphon, as follows: "We call
you to the Book of God Almighty and Glorious, and to the
<i>Sunna</i> (custom) of the Prophet&mdash;on whom be peace!&mdash;and to
the administration of Ab&uacute; Bakr and &#8216;Umar&mdash;may God be
well pleased with them!&mdash;and to renounce &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n and
&#8216;Al&iacute; because they corrupted the true religion and abandoned
the authority of the Book."<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> From this it appears that the
Kh&aacute;rijite programme was simply the old Islam of equality and
fraternity, which had never been fully realised and was now
irretrievably ruined. Theoretically, all devout Moslems shared
in the desire for its restoration and condemned the existing
Government no less cordially than did the Kh&aacute;rijites. What
distinguished the latter party was the remorseless severity with
which they carried their principles into action. To them it
was absolutely vital that the Im&aacute;m, or head of the community,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_211" id="Page_211" href="#"><span><i>THE KH&Aacute;RIJITES</i></span>211</a></span>

should rule in the name and according to the will
of God: those who followed any other sealed their doom in
the next world: eternal salvation hung upon the choice of
a successor to the Prophet. Moslems who refused to execrate
&#8216;Uthm&aacute;n and &#8216;Al&iacute; were the worst of infidels; it was the duty
of every true believer to take part in the Holy War against
such, and to kill them, together with their wives and children.
These atrocities recoiled upon the insurgents, who soon found
themselves in danger of extermination. Milder counsels began
to prevail. Thus the Ib&aacute;&#7693;ites (followers of &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Ib&aacute;&#7693;)
held it lawful to live amongst the Moslems and mix with
them on terms of mutual tolerance. But compromise was
in truth incompatible with the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the Kh&aacute;rijites,
namely, to establish the kingdom of God upon the earth.
This meant virtual anarchy: "their unbending logic shattered
every constitution which it set up." As &#8216;Al&iacute; remarked, "they
say, 'No government' (<i>l&aacute; im&aacute;ra</i>), but there must be a government,
good or bad."<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> Nevertheless, it was a noble ideal for
which they fought in pure devotion, having, unlike the other
political parties, no worldly interests to serve.</p>

<p>The same fierce spirit of fanaticism moulded their religious
views, which were gloomy and austere, as befitted the chosen
<span class="sidenote"> Their religion.</span>
few in an ungodly world. Shahrast&aacute;n&iacute;, speaking
of the original twelve thousand who rebelled
against &#8216;Al&iacute;, describes them as 'people of fasting and
prayer' (<i>ahlu &#7779;iy&aacute;m<sup>in</sup> wa-&#7779;al&aacute;t<sup>in</sup></i>).<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> The Koran ruled their
lives and possessed their imaginations, so that the history
of the early Church, the persecutions, martyrdoms, and
triumphs of the Faith became a veritable drama which was
being enacted by themselves. The fear of hell kindled in
them an inquisitorial zeal for righteousness. They scrupulously
examined their own belief as well as that of their
neighbours, and woe to him that was found wanting! A

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_212" id="Page_212" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>212</a></span>

single false step involved excommunication from the pale of
Islam, and though the slip might be condoned on proof of
sincere repentance, any Moslem who had once committed a
mortal sin (<i>kab&iacute;ra</i>) was held, by the stricter Kh&aacute;rijites at
least, to be inevitably damned with the infidels in everlasting
fire.</p>

<p class="tb">Much might be written, if space allowed, concerning the
wars of the Kh&aacute;rijites, their most famous chiefs, the points on
which they quarrelled, and the sects into which they split.
Here we can only attempt to illustrate the general character of
the movement. We have touched on its political and religious
aspects, and shall now conclude with some reference to its
literary side. The Kh&aacute;rijites did not produce a Milton or
a Bunyan, but as Arabs of Bedouin stock they had a natural
gift of song, from which they could not be <span class="sidenote"> Kh&aacute;rijite
poetry.</span>
weaned; although, according to the strict letter
of the Koran, poetry is a devilish invention
improper for the pious Moslem to meddle with. But these
are poems of a different order from the pagan odes, and
breathe a stern religious enthusiasm that would have
gladdened the Prophet's heart. Take, for example, the following
verses, which were made by a Kh&aacute;rijite in prison:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>The murder of &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n broke the Moslem community,
which had hitherto been undivided, into two <i>sh&iacute;&#8216;as</i>, or parties&mdash;one
<span class="sidenote">The Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites.</span>
for &#8216;Al&iacute; and the other for Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya. When
the latter became Caliph he was no longer a party
leader, but head of the State, and his <i>sh&iacute;&#8216;a</i> ceased to exist.
Henceforth 'the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a' <i>par excellence</i> was the party of &#8216;Al&iacute;,
which regarded the House of the Prophet as the legitimate
heirs to the succession. Not content, however, with upholding

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_214" id="Page_214" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>214</a></span>

&#8216;Al&iacute;, as the worthiest of the Prophet's Companions and the
duly elected Caliph, against his rival, Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, the bolder
spirits took up an idea, which emerged about <span class="sidenote"> The theory of
Divine Right.</span>
this time, that the Caliphate belonged to &#8216;Al&iacute;
and his descendants by Divine right. Such is
the distinctive doctrine of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites to the present day. It
is generally thought to have originated in Persia, where the
S&aacute;s&aacute;nian kings used to assume the title of 'god' (Pahlav&iacute;
<i>bagh</i>) and were looked upon as successive incarnations of the
Divine majesty.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Although the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites," says Dozy, "often found themselves
under the direction of Arab leaders, who utilised them in order
<span class="sidenote"> Dozy's account
of its origin.</span>
to gain some personal end, they were nevertheless a
Persian sect at bottom; and it is precisely here that
the difference most clearly showed itself between the
Arab race, which loves liberty, and the Persian race, accustomed
to slavish submission. For the Persians, the principle of electing
the Prophet's successor was something unheard of and incomprehensible.
The only principle which they recognised was that of
inheritance, and since Mu&#7717;ammad left no sons, they thought that
his son-in-law &#8216;Al&iacute; should have succeeded him, and that the
sovereignty was hereditary in his family. Consequently, all the
Caliphs except &#8216;Al&iacute;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Ab&uacute; Bakr, &#8216;Umar, and &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n, as well
as the Umayyads&mdash;were in their eyes usurpers to whom no
obedience was due. The hatred which they felt for the Government
and for Arab rule confirmed them in this opinion; at the
same time they cast covetous looks on the wealth of their masters.
Habituated, moreover, to see in their kings the descendants of the
inferior divinities, they transferred this idolatrous veneration to &#8216;Al&iacute;
and his posterity. Absolute obedience to the Im&aacute;m of &#8216;Al&iacute;'s House
was in their eyes the most important duty; if that were fulfilled all
the rest might be interpreted allegorically and violated without
scruple. For them the Im&aacute;m was everything; he was God made

Now, the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite theory of Divine Right certainly harmonised
with Persian ideas, but was it also of Persian <span class="sidenote">The Saba&#8217;ites.</span>
origin? On the contrary, it seems first to have
arisen among an obscure Arabian sect, the
Saba&#8217;ites, whose founder, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Sab&aacute; (properly, Saba&#8217;),
was a native of &#7778;an&#8216;&aacute; in Yemen, and is said to have been a
Jew.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> In &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n's time he turned Moslem and became,
apparently, a travelling missionary. "He went from place to
place," says the historian, "seeking to lead the Moslems into
error."<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> We hear of him in the &#7716;ij&aacute;z, then in Ba&#7779;ra and K&uacute;fa,
then in Syria. Finally he settled in Egypt, where he preached
the doctrine of palingenesis (<i>raj&#8216;a</i>). "It is strange indeed," he
exclaimed, "that any one should believe in the <span class="sidenote"> Doctrine of
Ibn Sab&aacute;.</span>
return of Jesus (as Messias), and deny the return
of Mu&#7717;ammad, which God has announced
(Kor. xxviii, 85).<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> Furthermore, there are a thousand
Prophets, every one of whom has an executor (<i>wa&#7779;&iacute;</i>), and
the executor of Mu&#7717;ammad is &#8216;Al&iacute;.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Mu&#7717;ammad is the last
of the Prophets, and &#8216;Al&iacute; is the last of the executors." Ibn
Sab&aacute;, therefore, regarded Ab&uacute; Bakr, &#8216;Umar, and &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n as
usurpers. He set on foot a widespread conspiracy in favour
of &#8216;Al&iacute;, and carried on a secret correspondence with the
disaffected in various provinces of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> According

to Shahrast&aacute;n&iacute;, he was banished by &#8216;Al&iacute; for saying, "Thou
art thou" (<i>anta anta</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, "Thou art God."<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> This refers
to the doctrine taught by Ibn Sab&aacute; and the extreme Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites
(<i>Ghul&aacute;t</i>) who derive from him, that the Divine Spirit which
dwells in every prophet and passes successively from one to
another was transfused, at Mu&#7717;ammad's death, into &#8216;Al&iacute;, and
from &#8216;Al&iacute; into his descendants who succeeded him in the
Im&aacute;mate. The Saba&#8217;ites also held that the Im&aacute;m might suffer
a temporary occultation (<i>ghayba</i>), but that one day he would
return and fill the earth with justice. They believed the
millennium to be near at hand, so that the number of Im&aacute;ms
was at first limited to four. Thus the poet Kuthayyir
(&#8224;&nbsp;723 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">

<p>The Messianic idea is not peculiar to the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, but was
brought into Islam at an early period by Jewish and Christian
converts, and soon established itself as a part of Mu&#7717;ammadan
belief. Traditions ascribed to the Prophet began to circulate,
declaring that the approach of the Last Judgment would be
heralded by a time of tumult and confusion, by the return of
Jesus, who would slay the Antichrist (<i>al-Dajj&aacute;l</i>), <span class="sidenote"> The Mahd&iacute;
or Messiah.</span>
and finally by the coming of the Mahd&iacute;, <i>i.e.</i>,
'the God-guided one,' who would fill the earth
with justice even as it was then filled with violence and
iniquity. This expectation of a Deliverer descended from the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_217" id="Page_217" href="#"><span><i>THE SH&Iacute;&#8216;ITES</i></span>217</a></span>

Prophet runs through the whole history of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a. As
we have seen, their supreme religious chiefs were the Im&aacute;ms of
&#8216;Al&iacute;'s House, each of whom transmitted his authority to his
successor. In the course of time disputes arose as to the
succession. One sect acknowledged only seven legitimate
Im&aacute;ms, while another carried the number to twelve. The
last Im&aacute;m of the 'Seveners' (<i>al-Sab&#8216;iyya</i>), who are commonly
called Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s, was Mu&#7717;ammad b. Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l, and of the
'Twelvers' (<i>al-Ithn&aacute;-&#8216;ashariyya</i>) Mu&#7717;ammad b. al-&#7716;asan.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>
Both those personages vanished mysteriously about 770 and
870 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and their respective followers, refusing to believe
that they were dead, asserted that their Im&aacute;m had withdrawn
himself for a season from mortal sight, but that he would
surely return at last as the promised Mahd&iacute;. It would take a
long while to enumerate all the pretenders and fanatics who
have claimed this title.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> Two of them founded the F&aacute;&#7789;imid
and Almohade dynasties, which we shall mention elsewhere,
but they generally died on the gibbet or the battle-field. The
ideal which they, so to speak, incarnated did not perish with
them. Mahdiism, the faith in a divinely appointed revolution
which will sweep away the powers of evil and usher in a
Golden Age of justice and truth such as the world has never
known, is a present and inspiring fact which deserves to be well
weighed by those who doubt the possibility of an Islamic
Reformation.</p>

<p>The Sh&iacute;&#8216;a began as a political faction, but it could not
remain so for any length of time, because in Islam politics
always tend to take religious ground, just as the successful
religious reformer invariably becomes a ruler. The Saba&#8217;ites
furnished the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite movement with a theological basis; and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_218" id="Page_218" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>218</a></span>

the massacre of &#7716;usayn, followed by Mukht&aacute;r's rebellion,
supplied the indispensable element of enthusiasm. Within a
few years after the death of &#7716;usayn his grave at <span class="sidenote">Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite
gatherings at
Karbal&aacute;.</span>
Karbal&aacute; was already a place of pilgrimage for the
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites. When the 'Penitents' (<i>al-Taww&aacute;b&uacute;n</i>)
revolted in 684 they repaired thither and lifted their voices
simultaneously in a loud wail, and wept, and prayed God that
He would forgive them for having deserted the Prophet's
grandson in his hour of need. "O God!" exclaimed their
chief, "have mercy on &#7716;usayn, the Martyr and the son of a
Martyr, the Mahd&iacute; and the son of a Mahd&iacute;, the &#7778;idd&iacute;q and
the son of a &#7778;idd&iacute;q!<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> O God! we bear witness that we follow
their religion and their path, and that we are the foes of their
slayers and the friends of those who love them."<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> Here is the
germ of the <i>ta&#8216;ziyas</i>, or Passion Plays, which are acted every
year on the 10th of Mu&#7717;arram, wherever Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites are to be
found.</p>

<p>But the Moses of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a, the man who showed them the
way to victory although he did not lead them to it, is undoubtedly
<span class="sidenote"> Mukht&aacute;r.</span>
Mukht&aacute;r. He came forward in the
name of &#8216;Al&iacute;'s son, Mu&#7717;ammad, generally known
as Ibnu &#8217;l-&#7716;anafiyya after his mother. Thus he gained the
support of the Arabian Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, properly so called, who were
devoted to &#8216;Al&iacute; and his House, and laid no stress upon the
circumstance of descent from the Prophet, whereas the
Persian adherents of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a made it a vital matter, and held
accordingly that only the sons of &#8216;Al&iacute; by his wife F&aacute;&#7789;ima were
fully qualified Im&aacute;ms. Raising the cry of vengeance for
&#7716;usayn, Mukht&aacute;r carried this party also along with him. In
686 he found himself master of K&uacute;fa. Neither the result of
his triumph nor the rapid overthrow of his power concerns us

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_219" id="Page_219" href="#"><span><i>THE SHI&#8216;ITES</i></span>219</a></span>

here, but something must be said about the aims and character
of the movement which he headed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"More than half the population of K&uacute;fa was composed of <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>
(Clients), who monopolised handicraft, trade, and commerce. They
<span class="sidenote">The <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>
of K&uacute;fa.</span>
were mostly Persians in race and language; they
had come to K&uacute;fa as prisoners of war and had there
passed over to Islam: then they were manumitted by
their owners and received as clients into the Arab tribes, so that
they now occupied an ambiguous position (<i>Zwitterstellung</i>), being
no longer slaves, but still very dependent on their patrons; needing
their protection, bound to their service, and forming their retinue in
peace and war. In these <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>, who were entitled by virtue of
Islam to more than the 'dominant Arabism' allowed them, the hope
now dawned of freeing themselves from clientship and of rising to
full and direct participation in the Moslem state."<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p></div>

<p class="tb">Mukht&aacute;r, though himself an Arab of noble family, trusted
the <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> and treated them as equals, a proceeding which
<span class="sidenote">Mukht&aacute;r and
the <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>.</span>
was bitterly resented by the privileged class.
"You have taken away our clients who are the
booty which God bestowed upon us together with
this country. We emancipated them, hoping to receive the
Divine recompense and reward, but you would not rest until
you made them sharers in our booty."<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> Mukht&aacute;r was only
giving the <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> their due&mdash;they were Moslems and had
the right, as such, to a share in the revenues. To the haughty
Arabs, however, it appeared a monstrous thing that the
despised foreigners should be placed on the same level with
themselves. Thus Mukht&aacute;r was thrown into the arms of the
<i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>, and the movement now became not so <span class="sidenote">Persian influence
on the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a.</span>
much anti-Umayyad as anti-Arabian. Here is
the turning-point in the history of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a. Its
ranks were swelled by thousands of Persians imbued with
the extreme doctrines of the Saba&#8217;ites which have been

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_220" id="Page_220" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>220</a></span>

sketched above, and animated by the intense hatred of a downtrodden
people towards their conquerors and oppressors.
Consequently the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a assumed a religious and enthusiastic
character, and struck out a new path which led it farther and
farther from the orthodox creed. The doctrine of 'Interpretation'
(<i>Ta&#8217;w&iacute;l</i>) opened the door to all sorts of extravagant
ideas. One of the principal Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite sects, the H&aacute;shimiyya, held
that "there is an esoteric side to everything external, a spirit
to every form, a hidden meaning (<i>ta&#8217;w&iacute;l</i>) to every revelation,
and to every similitude in this world a corresponding reality in
the other world; that &#8216;Al&iacute; united in his own person the
knowledge of all mysteries and communicated it to his son
Mu&#7717;ammad Ibnu &#8217;l-&#7716;anafiyya, who passed it on to his son
Ab&uacute; H&aacute;shim; and that the possessor of this universal knowledge
is the true Im&aacute;m."<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> So, without ceasing to be Moslems
in name, the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites transmuted Islam into whatever shape
they pleased by virtue of a mystical interpretation based on the
infallible authority of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad, and out of the
ruins of a political party there gradually arose a great religious
organisation in which men of the most diverse opinions could
work together for deliverance from the Umayyad yoke. The
first step towards this development was made by Mukht&aacute;r, a
versatile genius who seems to have combined the parts of
political adventurer, social reformer, prophet, and charlatan.
He was crushed and his Persian allies were decimated, but the
seed which he had sown bore an abundant harvest when, sixty
years later, Ab&uacute; Muslim unfurled the black standard of the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sids in Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n.</p>

<p class="tb">Concerning the origin of the oldest theological sects in
Islam, the Murjites and the Mu&#8216;tazilites, we possess too little
contemporary evidence to make a positive statement. It is
probable that the latter at any rate arose, as Von Kremer
has suggested, under the influence of Greek theologians,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_221" id="Page_221" href="#"><span><i>THE MURJITES</i></span>221</a></span>

especially John of Damascus and his pupil, Theodore Abucara
(Ab&uacute; Qurra), the Bishop of &#7716;arr&aacute;n.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> Christians were freely
admitted to the Umayyad court. The Christian <span class="sidenote"> The oldest
theological sects.</span>
al-Akh&#7789;al was poet-laureate, while many of his
co-religionists held high offices in the Government.
Moslems and Christians exchanged ideas in friendly discussion
or controversially. Armed with the hair-splitting weapons of
Byzantine theology, which they soon learned to use only too
well, the Arabs proceeded to try their edge on the dogmas of
Islam.</p>

<p>The leading article of the Murjite creed was this, that no
one who professed to believe in the One God could be
<span class="sidenote"> The Murjites.</span>
declared an infidel, whatever sins he might
commit, until God Himself had given judgment
against him.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> The Murjites were so called because they
deferred (<i>arja&#8217;a</i> = to defer) their decision in such cases and
left the sinner's fate in suspense, so long as it was doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a>
This principle they applied in different ways. For example,
they refused to condemn &#8216;Al&iacute; and &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n outright, as the
Kh&aacute;rijites did. "Both &#8216;Al&iacute; and &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n," they said, "were
servants of God, and by God alone must they be judged; it is
not for us to pronounce either of them an infidel, notwithstanding
that they rent the Moslem people asunder."<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> On
the other hand, the Murjites equally rejected the pretensions

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_222" id="Page_222" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>222</a></span>

made by the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites on behalf of &#8216;Al&iacute; and by the Umayyads
on behalf of Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya. For the most part they maintained
a neutral attitude towards the Umayyad Government: they
were passive resisters, content, as Wellhausen puts it, "to
stand up for the impersonal Law." Sometimes, however, they
turned the principle of toleration against their rulers. Thus
&#7716;&aacute;rith b. Surayj and other Arabian Murjites joined the
oppressed <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n to whom the Government
denied those rights which they had acquired by conversion.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a>
According to the Murjite view, these Persians,
having professed Islam, should no longer be treated as tax-paying
infidels. The Murjites brought the same tolerant
spirit into religion. They set faith above works, emphasised
the love and goodness of God, and held that no Moslem would
be damned everlastingly. Some, like Jahm b. &#7778;afw&aacute;n, went so
far as to declare that faith (<i>&iacute;m&aacute;n</i>) was merely an inward conviction:
a man might openly profess Christianity or Judaism
or any form of unbelief without ceasing to be a good Moslem,
provided only that he acknowledged Allah with his heart.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
The moderate school found their most illustrious representative
in Ab&uacute; &#7716;an&iacute;fa (&#8224;&nbsp;767 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and through this great divine&mdash;whose
followers to-day are counted by millions&mdash;their liberal
doctrines were diffused and perpetuated.</p>

<p>During the Umayyad period Ba&#7779;ra was the intellectual
capital of Islam, and in that city we find the first traces of a
<span class="sidenote">The Mu&#8216;tazilites.</span>
sect which maintained the principle that thought
must be free in the search for truth. The origin
of the Mu&#8216;tazilites (<i>al-Mu&#8216;tazila</i>), as they are generally called,
takes us back to the famous divine and ascetic, &#7716;asan of
Ba&#7779;ra (&#8224;728 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). One day he was asked to give his opinion
on a point regarding which the Murjites and the Kh&aacute;rijites
held opposite views, namely, whether those who had committed

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_223" id="Page_223" href="#"><span><i>THE MU&#8216;TAZILITES</i></span>223</a></span>

a great sin should be deemed believers or unbelievers. While
&#7716;asan was considering the question, one of his pupils, W&aacute;&#7779;il b.
&#8216;A&#7789;&aacute; (according to another tradition, &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Ubayd) replied
that such persons were neither believers nor unbelievers, but
should be ranked in an intermediate state. He then turned
aside and began to explain the grounds of his assertion to a
group which gathered about him in a different part of the
mosque. &#7716;asan said: "W&aacute;&#7779;il has separated himself from us"
(<i>i&#8216;tazala &#8216;ann&aacute;</i>); and on this account the followers of W&aacute;&#7779;il
were named 'Mu&#8216;tazilites,' <i>i.e.</i>, Schismatics. Although the
story may not be literally true, it is probably safe to assume
that the new sect originated in Ba&#7779;ra among the pupils of
&#7716;asan,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> who was the life and soul of the religious movement
of the first century <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> The Mu&#8216;tazilite heresy, in its
earliest form, is connected with the doctrine of Predestination.
On this subject the Koran speaks with two voices. Mu&#7717;ammad
was anything but a logically exact and consistent thinker.
He was guided by the impulse of the moment, and neither he
nor his hearers perceived, as later Moslems did, that the language
of the Koran is often contradictory. Thus in the
present instance texts which imply the moral responsibility of
man for his actions&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, "<i>Every soul is in pledge</i> (with
God) <i>for what it hath wrought</i>"<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a>; "<i>Whoso does good
benefits himself, and whoso does evil does it against himself</i>"<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>&mdash;stand
side by side with others which declare that God leads men
aright or astray, as He pleases; that the hearts of the wicked
are sealed and their ears made deaf to the truth; and that
they are certainly doomed to perdition. This fatalistic view
prevailed in the first century of Islam, and the dogma of Predestination
was almost universally accepted. Ibn Qutayba,
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_224" id="Page_224" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>224</a></span>
however, mentions the names of twenty-seven persons who held
the opinion that men's actions are free.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> Two among them,
Ma&#8216;bad al-Juhan&iacute; and Ab&uacute; Marw&aacute;n Ghayl&aacute;n, who were put to
death by &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik and his son Hish&aacute;m, do not appear to
have been condemned as heretics, but rather as enemies of the
Umayyad Government.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> The real founder of the Mu&#8216;tazilites
was W&aacute;&#7779;il b. &#8216;A&#7789;&aacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;748 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> who added a second cardinal
doctrine to that of free-will. He denied the existence of the
Divine attributes&mdash;Power, Wisdom, Life, &amp;c.&mdash;on the ground
that such qualities, if conceived as eternal, would destroy the
Unity of God. Hence the Mu&#8216;tazilites called themselves
'the partisans of Unity and Justice' (<i>Ahlu&#8217;l-taw&#7717;&iacute;d wa-&#8217;l-&#8216;adl</i>):
of Unity for the reason which has been explained, and of
Justice, because they held that God was not the author of evil
and that He would not punish His creatures except for actions
within their control. The further development of these
Rationalistic ideas belongs to the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period and will be
discussed in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p class="tb">The founder of Islam had too much human nature and
common sense to demand of his countrymen such mortifying
<span class="sidenote"> Growth of
asceticism.</span>
austerities as were practised by the Jewish Essenes
and the Christian monks. His religion was not
without ascetic features, <i>e.g.</i>, the Fast of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n,
the prohibition of wine, and the ordinance of the pilgrimage,
but these can scarcely be called unreasonable. On the other
hand Mu&#7717;ammad condemned celibacy not only by his personal

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_225" id="Page_225" href="#"><span><i>THE ASCETIC MOVEMENT</i></span>225</a></span>

example but also by precept. "There is no monkery in
Islam," he is reported to have said, and there was in fact
nothing of the kind for more than a century after his death.
During this time, however, asceticism made great strides. It
was the inevitable outcome of the Mu&#7717;ammadan conception
of Allah, in which the attributes of mercy and love are overshadowed
by those of majesty, awe, and vengeance. The
terrors of Judgment Day so powerfully described in the Koran
were realised with an intensity of conviction which it is
difficult for us to imagine. As Goldziher has observed, an
exaggerated consciousness of sin and the dread of Divine punishment
gave the first impulse to Moslem asceticism. Thus we
read that Tam&iacute;m al-D&aacute;r&iacute;, one of the Prophet's Companions,
who was formerly a Christian, passed the whole night until
daybreak, repeating a single verse of the Koran (xlv, 20)&mdash;"<i>Do
those who work evil think that We shall make them even
as those who believe and do good, so that their life and death
shall be equal? Ill do they judge!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> Abu &#8217;l-Dard&aacute;, another

see after death, ye would not eat food nor drink water from
appetite, and I wish that I were a tree which is lopped and
then devoured."<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> There were many who shared these views,
and their determination to renounce the world and to live

spectacle of bloodshed, rapine, and civil war. &#7716;asan <span class="sidenote"> &#7716;asan of Ba&#7779;ra.</span>

appears like that of the Messiah." So they went, and they
found him supporting his chin on the palm of his hand, while
he was saying&mdash;"How I marvel at those who have been

viz., those which connect it with &#963;&#959;&#966;&#972;&#962; (wise) or

lofty significance which commended it to the elect. Nevertheless
it can be tracked to a quite humble source. Woollen
garments were frequently worn by men of ascetic life in the
early times of Islam in order (as Ibn Khald&uacute;n says) that they
might distinguish themselves from those who affected a more
luxurious fashion of dress. Hence the name '&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;,' which
denotes in the first instance an ascetic clad in wool (<i>&#7779;&uacute;f</i>), just
as the Capuchins owed their designation to the hood (<i>cappuccio</i>)
which they wore. According to Qushayr&iacute;, the term came
into common use before the end of the second century of the
Hijra ( = 815 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). By this time, however, the ascetic movement
in Islam had to some extent assumed a new character,
and the meaning of '&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;,' if the word already existed, must
have undergone a corresponding change. It seems to me not
unlikely that the epithet in question marks the point of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_229" id="Page_229" href="#"><span><i>EARLY &#7778;&Uacute;FIISM</i></span>229</a></span>

departure from orthodox asceticism and that, as J&aacute;m&iacute; states,
it was first applied to Ab&uacute; H&aacute;shim of K&uacute;fa (<i>ob.</i> before 800<span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>),
who founded a monastery (<i>kh&aacute;naq&aacute;h</i>) for &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s at <span class="sidenote"> The beginnings
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
Ramla in Palestine. Be that as it may, the distinction
between asceticism (<i>zuhd</i>) and &#7778;&uacute;fiism&mdash;a
distinction which answers, broadly speaking, to the <i>via purgativa</i>
and the <i>via illuminativa</i> of Western medi&aelig;val mysticism&mdash;begins
to show itself before the close of the Umayyad period, and
rapidly develops in the early &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid age under the influence of
foreign ideas and, in particular, of Greek philosophy. Leaving
this later development to be discussed in a subsequent chapter,
we shall now briefly consider the origin of &#7778;&uacute;fiism properly so
called and the first manifestation of the peculiar tendencies on
which it is based.</p>

<p class="tb">As regards its origin, we cannot do better than quote the
observations with which Ibn Khald&uacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;1406 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) introduces
the chapter on &#7778;&uacute;fiism in the Prolegomena to his great
historical work:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is one of the religious sciences which were born in Islam.
The way of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s was regarded by the ancient Moslems and
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn Khald&uacute;n's
account of the
origin of &#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
their illustrious men&mdash;the Companions of the Prophet
(<i>al-&#7778;a&#7717;&aacute;ba</i>), the Successors (<i>al-T&aacute;bi&#8216;&uacute;n</i>), and the
generation which came after them&mdash;as the way of
Truth and Salvation. To be assiduous in piety, to give up all else
for God's sake, to turn away from worldly gauds and vanities, to
renounce pleasure, wealth, and power, which are the general
objects of human ambition, to abandon society and to lead in
seclusion a life devoted solely to the service of God&mdash;these were the
fundamental principles of &#7778;&uacute;fiism which prevailed among the
Companions and the Moslems of old time. When, however, in
the second generation and afterwards worldly tastes became widely
spread, and men no longer shrank from such contamination, those
who made piety their aim were distinguished by the title of <i>&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s</i>
or <i>Muta&#7779;awwifa</i> (aspirants to &#7778;&uacute;fiism).<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_230" id="Page_230" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>230</a></span></p>

<p>From this it is clear that &#7778;&uacute;fiism, if not originally identical
with the ascetic revolt of which, as we have seen, &#7716;asan of
<span class="sidenote"> The earliest form
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
Ba&#7779;ra was the most conspicuous representative,
at any rate arose out of that movement. It was
not a speculative system, like the Mu&#8216;tazilite
heresy, but a practical religion and rule of life. "We derived
&#7778;&uacute;fiism," said Junayd, "from fasting and taking leave of the
world and breaking familiar ties and renouncing what men
deem good; not from disputation" (<i>q&iacute;l wa-q&aacute;l</i>).<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> The oldest
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s were ascetics and hermits, but they were also something
more. They brought out the spiritual and mystical element in
Islam, or brought it in, if they did not find it there already.</p>

<p>"&#7778;&uacute;fiism," says Suhraward&iacute;,<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> "is neither 'poverty' (<i>faqr</i>)
nor asceticism (<i>zuhd</i>), but a term which comprehends the ideas
<span class="sidenote"> The difference
between
asceticism
and &#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
of both, together with something besides. Without
these superadded qualities a man is not a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;,
though he may be an ascetic (<i>z&aacute;hid</i>) or a fak&iacute;r
(<i>faq&iacute;r</i>). It is said that, notwithstanding the excellence
of 'poverty,' the end thereof is only the beginning
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism." A little further on he explains the difference
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The fak&iacute;r holds fast to his 'poverty' and is profoundly convinced
of its superior merit. He prefers it to riches because he
longs for the Divine recompense of which his faith assures him ...
and whenever he contemplates the everlasting reward, he abstains
from the fleeting joys of this world and embraces poverty and
indigence and fears that if he should cease to be 'poor' he will lose
both the merit and the prize. Now this is absolutely unsound
according to the doctrine of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, because he hopes for recompense
and renounces the world on that account, whereas the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; does
not renounce it for the sake of promised rewards but, on the contrary,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_231" id="Page_231" href="#"><span><i>EARLY &#7778;&Uacute;FIISM</i></span>231</a></span>

for the sake of present 'states,' for he is the 'son of his time.'...<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a>
The theory that 'poverty' is the foundation of &#7778;&uacute;fiism signifies that
the diverse stages of &#7778;&uacute;fiism are reached by the road of 'poverty';
it does not imply that the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; is essentially a fak&iacute;r."</p></div>

<p>The keynote of &#7778;&uacute;fiism is disinterested, selfless devotion,
in a word, Love. Though not wholly strange, this idea
was very far from being familiar to pious Mu&#7717;ammadans,
who were more deeply impressed by the power and vengeance
of God than by His goodness and mercy. The
Koran generally represents Allah as a stern, unapproachable
despot, requiring utter submission to His arbitrary will,
but infinitely unconcerned with human feelings and aspirations.
Such a Being could not satisfy the religious instinct,
and the whole history of &#7778;&uacute;fiism is a protest against the
unnatural divorce between God and Man which this conception
involves. Accordingly, I do not think that we need look
beyond Islam for the origin of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; doctrines, although it
would be a mistake not to recognise the part which Christian
influence must have had in shaping their early development.
The speculative character with which they gradually became
imbued, and which in the course of time completely transformed
them, was more or less latent during the Umayyad period
and for nearly a century after the accession of the House of
&#8216;Abb&aacute;s. The early &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s are still on orthodox ground: their
relation to Islam is not unlike that of the <span class="sidenote"> The early &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s.</span>
medi&aelig;val Spanish mystics to the Roman Catholic
Church. They attach extraordinary value to certain points
in Mu&#7717;ammad's teaching and emphasise them so as to leave
the others almost a dead letter. They do not indulge in
profound dialectic, but confine themselves to matters bearing
on practical theology. Self-abandonment, rigorous self-mortification,
fervid piety, and quietism carried to the verge of apathy
form the main features of their creed.</p>

A full and vivid picture of early &#7778;&uacute;fiism might be drawn
from the numerous biographies in Arabic and Persian, which
<span class="sidenote"> Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m b.
Adham.</span>
supply abundant details concerning the manner
of life of these Mu&#7717;ammadan Saints, and faithfully
record their austerities, visions, miracles,
and sayings. Here we have only space to add a few lines
about the most important members of the group&mdash;Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m
b. Adham, Ab&uacute; &#8216;Al&iacute; Shaq&iacute;q, Fu&#7693;ayl b. &#8216;Iy&aacute;&#7693;, and R&aacute;bi&#8216;a&mdash;all
of whom died between the middle and end of the second
century after the Hijra (767-815 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m belonged
to the royal family of Balkh. Forty scimitars of gold and
forty maces of gold were borne in front of him and behind.
One day, while hunting, he heard a voice which cried,
"Awake! wert thou created for this?" He exchanged
his splendid robes for the humble garb and felt cap of a
shepherd, bade farewell to his kingdom, and lived for nine
years in a cave near Nays&aacute;b&uacute;r.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> His customary prayer
was, "O God, uplift me from the shame of disobedience
to the glory of submission unto Thee!"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"O God!" he said, "Thou knowest that the Eight Paradises are
little beside the honour which Thou hast done unto me, and beside
Thy love, and beside Thy giving me intimacy with the praise of Thy
name, and beside the peace of mind which Thou hast given me
when I meditate on Thy majesty." And again: "You will not
attain to righteousness until you traverse six passes (<i>&#8216;aqab&aacute;t</i>): the
first is that you shut the door of pleasure and open the door of
hardship; the second, that you shut the door of eminence and open
the door of abasement; the third, that you shut the door of ease and
open the door of affliction; the fourth, that you shut the door of
sleep and open the door of wakefulness; the fifth, that you shut the
door of riches and open the door of poverty; and the sixth, that
you shut the door of expectation and open the door of making yourself
ready for death."</p></div>

Shaq&iacute;q, also of Balkh, laid particular stress on the duty
of leaving one's self entirely in God's hands (<i>tawakkul</i>), a
<span class="sidenote"> Shaq&iacute;q
of Balkh.</span>
term which is practically synonymous with
passivity; <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>mutawakkil</i> must make no
effort to obtain even the barest livelihood, he
must not ask for anything, nor engage in any trade: his
business is with God alone. One of Shaq&iacute;q's sayings was,
"Nine-tenths of devotion consist in flight from mankind,
the remaining tenth in silence." Similarly, <span class="sidenote">Fu&#7693;ayl b. &#8216;Iy&aacute;&#7693;.</span>
Fu&#7693;ayl b. &#8216;Iy&aacute;&#7693;, a converted captain of banditti,
declared that "to abstain for men's sake from doing anything
is hypocrisy, while to do anything for men's sake
is idolatry." It may be noticed as an argument against
the Indian origin of &#7778;&uacute;fiism that although the three
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s who have been mentioned were natives of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n
or Transoxania, and therefore presumably in touch with
Buddhistic ideas, no trace can be found in their sayings of
the doctrine of dying to self (<i>fan&aacute;</i>), which plays a great part
in subsequent &#7778;&uacute;fiism, and which Von Kremer and others
have identified with <i>Nirv&aacute;na</i>. We now come to a more
interesting personality, in whom the ascetic and quietistic
type of &#7778;&uacute;fiism is transfigured by emotion and begins clearly
to reveal the direction of its next advance. Every one
knows that women have borne a distinguished part in the
annals of European mysticism: St. Teresa, Madame Guyon,
Catharine of Siena, and Juliana of Norwich, to mention
but a few names at random. And notwithstanding
the intellectual death to which the majority of Moslem
women are condemned by their Prophet's ordinance, the
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, like the Roman Catholics, can boast a goodly number
of female saints. The oldest of these, and by <span class="sidenote">R&aacute;bi&#8216;a
al-&#8216;Adawiyya.</span>
far the most renowned, is R&aacute;bi&#8216;a, who belonged
to the tribe of &#8216;Ad&iacute;, whence she is generally
called R&aacute;bi&#8216;a al-&#8216;Adawiyya. She was a native of Ba&#7779;ra
and died at Jerusalem, probably towards the end of the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_234" id="Page_234" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>234</a></span>

second century of Islam: her tomb was an object of
pilgrimage in the Middle Ages, as we learn from Ibn
Khallik&aacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;1282 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Although the sayings and verses
attributed to her by &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; writers may be of doubtful
authenticity, there is every reason to suppose that they
fairly represent the actual character of her devotion, which
resembled that of all feminine mystics in being inspired by
tender and ardent feeling. She was asked: "Do you love
God Almighty?" "Yes." "Do you hate the Devil?"
"My love of God," she replied, "leaves me no leisure to
hate the Devil. I saw the Prophet in a dream. He said,
'O R&aacute;bi&#8216;a, do you love me?' I said, 'O Apostle of God,
who does not love thee?&mdash;but love of God hath so absorbed
me that neither love nor hate of any other thing remains
in my heart.'" R&aacute;bi&#8216;a is said to have spoken the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whether genuine or not, these lines, with their mixture
of devotion and speculation&mdash;the author distinguishes the
illuminative from the contemplative life and manifestly
regards the latter as the more excellent way&mdash;serve to
mark the end of the ascetic school of &#7778;&uacute;fiism and the rise of
a new theosophy which, under the same name and still
professing to be in full accord with the Koran and the
<i>Sunna</i>, was founded to some extent upon ideas of extraneous
origin&mdash;ideas irreconcilable with any revealed religion, and

kind), and secondly, according to Mu&#7717;ammadan
belief, is the actual Word of God, therefore <i>sui
generis</i> and beyond imitation. Again, the poets
whom the Prophet condemned were his most dangerous
opponents: he hated them not as poets but as propagators
and defenders of false ideals, and because they ridiculed his
teaching, while on the contrary he honoured and rewarded
those who employed their talents in the right way. If the
nomad minstrels and cavaliers who lived, as they sang, the
free life of the desert were never equalled by the brilliant
laureates of imperial Damascus and Baghd&aacute;d, the causes of
the decline cannot be traced to Mu&#7717;ammad's personal attitude,
but are due to various circumstances for which he is
only responsible in so far as he founded a religious and
political system that revolutionised Arabian society. The
poets of the period with which we are now dealing follow
slavishly in the footsteps of the ancients, as though Islam
had never been. Instead of celebrating the splendid victories

the sandy waste on the peerless camel, whose
fine points he particularly describes; and if he
should happen to be addressing the Caliph, it is ten to
one that he will credit that august personage with all the
virtues of a Bedouin Shaykh. "Fortunately the imitation
of the antique <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>, at any rate with the greatest Umayyad
poets, is to some extent only accessory to another form
of art that excites our historical interest in a high degree:
namely, the occasional poems (very numerous in almost
all these writers), which are suggested by the mood of
the moment and can shed a vivid light on contemporary
history."<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p class="tb">The conquests made by the successors of the Prophet
brought enormous wealth into Mecca and Med&iacute;na, and
<span class="sidenote"> Music and song
in the
Holy Cities.</span>
when the Umayyad aristocracy gained the
upper hand in &#8216;Uthm&aacute;n's Caliphate, these towns
developed a voluptuous and dissolute life which
broke through every restriction that Islam had imposed.
The increase of luxury produced a corresponding refinement
of the poetic art. Although music was not unknown
to the pagan Arabs, it had hitherto been cultivated chiefly
by foreigners, especially Greek and Persian singing-girls.
But in the first century after the Hijra we hear of several
Arab singers,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> natives of Mecca and Med&iacute;na, who set favourite
passages to music: henceforth the words and the melody
are inseparably united, as we learn from the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>
or 'Book of Songs,' where hundreds of examples are to be
found. Amidst the gay throng of pleasure-seekers women
naturally played a prominent part, and love, which had

hitherto formed in most cases merely the conventional prelude
to an ode, now began to be sung for its own sake.
In this Peninsular school, as it may be named in contrast
with the bold and masculine strain of the great Provincial
poets whom we are about to mention, the palm unquestionably
belongs to &#8216;Umar b. Ab&iacute; Rab&iacute;&#8216;a (&#8224;&nbsp;719 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Umar b. Ab&iacute;
Rab&iacute;&#8216;a.</span>
the son of a rich Meccan merchant. He passed
the best part of his life in the pursuit of noble
dames, who alone inspired him to sing. His poetry was so
seductive that it was regarded by devout Moslems as "the
greatest crime ever committed against God," and so charming
withal that &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. &#8216;Abb&aacute;s, the Prophet's cousin and
a famous authority on the Koran and the Traditions, could
not refrain from getting by heart some erotic verses which
&#8216;Umar recited to him.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> The Arabs said, with truth, that
the tribe of Quraysh had won distinction in every field
save poetry, but we must allow that &#8216;Umar b. Ab&iacute; Rab&iacute;&#8216;a
is a clear exception to this rule. His diction, like that of
Catullus, has all the unaffected ease of refined conversation.
Here are a few lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>We have no space to dwell on the minor poets of the same
school, al-&#8216;Arj&iacute; (a kinsman of the Umayyads), al-A&#7717;wa&#7779;, and
many others. It has been pointed out by Dr. C. Brockelmann

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_238" id="Page_238" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>238</a></span>

that the love-poetry of this epoch is largely of popular origin;
<i>e.g.</i>, the songs attributed to Jam&iacute;l, in which Buthayna is
addressed, and to Majn&uacute;n&mdash;the hero of countless <span class="sidenote"> Love-ballads.</span>
Persian and Turkish romances which celebrate
his love for Layl&aacute;&mdash;are true folk-songs such as occur in the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>, and may be heard in the streets of Beyrout
or on the banks of the Tigris at the present day. Many
of them are extremely beautiful. I take the following
verses from a poem which is said to have been composed
by Jam&iacute;l:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Oh, might it flower anew, that youthful prime,</span><span class="i0">
And restore to us, Buthayna, the bygone time!</span><span class="i0">
And might we again be blest as we wont to be,</span><span class="i0">
When thy folk were nigh and grudged what thou gavest me!</span><span class="i0">
&nbsp;</span><span class="i0">
Shall I ever meet Buthayna alone again,</span><span class="i0">
Each of us full of love as a cloud of rain?</span><span class="i0">
Fast in her net was I when a lad, and till</span><span class="i0">
This day my love is growing and waxing still.</span><span class="i0">
&nbsp;</span><span class="i0">
I have spent my lifetime, waiting for her to speak,</span><span class="i0">

</div></div>

<p>The names of al-Akh&#7789;al, al-Farazdaq, and Jar&iacute;r stand out
pre-eminently in the list of Umayyad poets. They were men
<span class="sidenote"> Poetry in the
provinces.</span>
of a very different stamp from the languishing
Minnesingers and carpet-knights who, like Jam&iacute;l,
refused to battle except on the field of love. It is
noteworthy that all three were born and bred in Mesopotamia.
The motherland was exhausted; her ambitious and enterprising
youth poured into the provinces, which now become
the main centres of intellectual activity.</p>

<p>Farazdaq and Jar&iacute;r are intimately connected by a peculiar
rivalry&mdash;"<i>Arcades ambo</i>&mdash;<i>id est</i>, blackguards both." For many
years they engaged in a public scolding-match (<i>muh&aacute;j&aacute;t</i>), and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_239" id="Page_239" href="#"><span><i>THE NAQ&Aacute;&#8217;I&#7692;</i></span>239</a></span>

as neither had any scruples on the score of decency, the foulest
abuse was bandied to and fro between them&mdash;abuse, however,
which is redeemed from vulgarity by its literary excellence,
and by the marvellous skill which the satirists display in
manipulating all the vituperative resources of the Arabic
language. Soon these 'Flytings' (<i>Naq&aacute;&#8217;i&#7693;</i>) <span class="sidenote">The <i>Naq&aacute;&#8217;i&#7693;</i> of
Jar&iacute;r and
Farazdaq.</span>
were recited everywhere, and each poet had
thousands of enthusiastic partisans who maintained
that he was superior to his rival.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> One day
Muhallab b. Ab&iacute; Sufra, the governor of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, who
was marching against the Az&aacute;riqa, a sect of the Kh&aacute;rijites,
heard a great clamour and tumult in the camp. On
inquiring its cause, he found that the soldiers had been
fiercely disputing as to the comparative merits of Jar&iacute;r and
Farazdaq, and desired to submit the question to his decision.
"Would you expose me," said Muhallab, "to be torn in
pieces by these two dogs? I will not decide between them,
but I will point out to you those who care not a whit for
either of them. Go to the Az&aacute;riqa! They are Arabs <span class="sidenote"> General interest
in poetry.</span>
who understand poetry and judge it aright."
Next day, when the armies faced each other,
an Azraqite named &#8216;Ab&iacute;da b. Hil&aacute;l stepped
forth from the ranks and offered single combat. One of
Muhallab's men accepted the challenge, but before fighting
he begged his adversary to inform him which was the
better poet&mdash;Farazdaq or Jar&iacute;r? "God confound you!"
cried &#8216;Ab&iacute;da, "do you ask me about poetry instead of
studying the Koran and the Sacred Law?" Then he
quoted a verse by Jar&iacute;r and gave judgment in his favour.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
This incident affords a striking proof that the taste for
poetry, far from being confined to literary circles, was
diffused throughout the whole nation, and was cultivated
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_240" id="Page_240" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>240</a></span>
even amidst the fatigues and dangers of war. Parallel
instances occur in the history of the Athenians, the most
gifted people of the West, and possibly elsewhere, but imagine
British soldiers discussing questions of that kind over the
camp-fires!</p>

<p>Akh&#7789;al joined in the fray. His sympathies were with
Farazdaq, and the <i>naq&aacute;&#8217;i&#7693;</i> which he and Jar&iacute;r composed
against each other have come down to us. All these poets,
like their Post-islamic brethren generally, were professional
encomiasts, greedy, venal, and ready to revile any one who
would not purchase their praise. Some further account of
them may be interesting to the reader, especially as the
anecdotes related by their biographers throw many curious
sidelights on the manners of the time.</p>

<p>The oldest of the trio, Akh&#7789;al (Ghiy&aacute;th b. Ghawth) of
Taghlib, was a Christian, like most of his tribe&mdash;they had
<span class="sidenote"> Akh&#7789;al.</span>
long been settled in Mesopotamia&mdash;and remained
in that faith to the end of his life, though the
Caliph &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik is said to have offered him a pension
and 10,000 dirhems in cash if he would turn Moslem. His
religion, however, was less a matter of principle than of
convenience, and to him the supreme virtue of Christianity
lay in the licence which it gave him to drink wine as often
as he pleased. The stories told of him suggest grovelling
devoutness combined with very easy morals, a phenomenon
familiar to the student of medi&aelig;val Catholicism. It is
related by one who was touring in Syria that he found
Akh&#7789;al confined in a church at Damascus, and pleaded his
cause with the priest. The latter stopped beside Akh&#7789;al and
raising the staff on which he leaned&mdash;for he was an aged man&mdash;exclaimed:
"O enemy of God, will you again defame
people and satirise them and caluminate chaste women?"
while the poet humbled himself and promised never to repeat
the offence. When asked how it was that he, who was
honoured by the Caliph and feared by all, behaved so

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_241" id="Page_241" href="#"><span><i>AKH&#7788;AL</i></span>241</a></span>

submissively to this priest, he answered, "It is religion, it
is religion."<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> On another occasion, seeing the Bishop pass,
he cried to his wife who was then pregnant, "Run after
him and touch his robe." The poor woman only succeeded
in touching the tail of the Bishop's ass, but Akh&#7789;al consoled
her with the remark, "He and the tail of his ass, there's
no difference!"<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> It is characteristic of the anti-Islamic
spirit which appears so strongly in the Umayyads that their
chosen laureate and champion should have been a Christian
who was in truth a lineal descendant of the pagan bards.
Pious Moslems might well be scandalised when he burst
unannounced into the Caliph's presence, sumptuously attired
in silk and wearing a cross of gold which was suspended
from his neck by a golden chain, while drops of
wine trickled from his beard,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> but their protests went
unheeded at the court of Damascus, where nobody cared
whether the author of a fine verse was a Moslem or a
Christian, and where a poet was doubly welcome whose
religion enabled him to serve his masters without any
regard to Mu&#7717;ammadan sentiment; so that, for example,
when Yaz&iacute;d I wished to take revenge on the people of
Med&iacute;na because one of their poets had addressed amatory
verses to his sister, he turned to Akh&#7789;al, who branded the
<i>An&#7779;&aacute;r</i>, the men who had brought about the triumph of
Islam, in the famous lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Quraysh have borne away all the honour and glory,</span><span class="i0">

</div></div>

<p>We must remember that the poets were leaders of public
opinion; their utterances took the place of political pamphlets
or of party oratory for or against the Government of the day.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_242" id="Page_242" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>242</a></span>

On hearing Akh&#7789;al's ode in praise of the Umayyad dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a>
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik ordered one of his clients to conduct the
author through the streets of Damascus and to cry out,
"Here is the poet of the Commander of the Faithful! Here
is the best poet of the Arabs!"<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> No wonder that he was
a favourite at court and such an eminent personage that
the great tribe of Bakr used to invite him to act as arbitrator
whenever any controversy arose among them.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> Despite the
luxury in which he lived, his wild Bedouin nature pined
for freedom, and he frequently left the capital to visit his
home in the desert, where he not only married and divorced
several wives, but also threw himself with ardour into the
feuds of his clan. We have already noticed the part which
he played in the literary duel between Jar&iacute;r and Farazdaq.
From his deathbed he sent a final injunction to Farazdaq
not to spare their common enemy.</p>

<p>Akh&#7789;al is commended by Arabian critics for the number and
excellence of his long poems, as well as for the purity, polish,
and correctness of his style. Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda put him first among
the poets of Islam, while the celebrated collector of Pre-islamic
poetry, Ab&uacute; &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;Al&aacute;, declared that if Akh&#7789;al
had lived a single day in the Pagan Age he would not have
preferred any one to him. His supremacy in panegyric was
acknowledged by Farazdaq, and he himself claims to have
surpassed all competitors in three styles, viz., panegyric,
satire, and erotic poetry; but there is more justification for
the boast that his satires might be recited <i>virginibus</i>&mdash;he
does not add <i>puerisque</i>&mdash;without causing a blush.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p class="tb">Hamm&aacute;m b. Gh&aacute;lib, generally known as Farazdaq, belonged
to the tribe of Tam&iacute;m, and was born at Ba&#7779;ra towards the end
of &#8216;Umar's Caliphate, His grandfather, &#7778;a&#8216;&#7779;a&#8216;a, won renown

in Pre-islamic times by ransoming the lives of female infants
whom their parents had condemned to die (on account of <span class="sidenote"> Farazdaq.</span>
which he received the title, <i>Mu&#7717;yi &#8217;l-Maw&#8217;&uacute;d&aacute;t</i>,
'He who brings the buried girls to life'), and
his father was likewise imbued with the old Bedouin traditions
of liberality and honour, which were rapidly growing obsolete
among the demoralised populace of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q. Farazdaq was a
<i>mauvais sujet</i> of the type represented by Fran&ccedil;ois Villon,
reckless, dissolute, and thoroughly unprincipled: apart from
his gift of vituperation, we find nothing in him to admire
save his respect for his father's memory and his constant
devotion to the House of &#8216;Al&iacute;, a devotion which he scorned
to conceal; so that he was cast into prison by the Caliph
Hish&aacute;m for reciting in his presence a glowing panegyric on
&#8216;Al&iacute;'s grandson, Zaynu &#8217;l-&#8216;&Aacute;bid&iacute;n. The tragic fate of &#7716;usayn
at Karbal&aacute; affected him deeply, and he called on his compatriots
to acquit themselves like men&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>While still a young man, he was expelled from his native
city in consequence of the lampoons which he directed against
a noble family of Ba&#7779;ra, the Ban&uacute; Nahshal. Thereupon he
fled to Med&iacute;na, where he plunged into gallantry and dissipation
until a shameless description of one of his intrigues
again drew upon him the sentence of banishment. His
poems contain many references to his cousin Naw&aacute;r, whom,
by means of a discreditable trick, he forced to marry him
when she was on the point of giving her hand to another.
The pair were ever quarrelling, and at last Farazdaq consented
to an irrevocable divorce, which was witnessed by
&#7716;asan of Ba&#7779;ra, the famous theologian. No sooner was

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_244" id="Page_244" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>244</a></span>

the act complete than Farazdaq began to wish it undone,
and he spoke the following verses:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<div class="poem">

</div></div>

<p>'The repentance of Farazdaq,' signifying bitter regret or
disappointment, passed into a proverb. He died a few
months before Jar&iacute;r in 728 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, a year also made notable
by the deaths of two illustrious divines, &#7716;asan of Ba&#7779;ra and
Ibn S&iacute;r&iacute;n.</p>

<p class="tb">Jar&iacute;r b. &#8216;Atiyya belonged to Kulayb, a branch of the same
tribe, Tam&iacute;m, which produced Farazdaq. He was the court-poet
<span class="sidenote"> Jar&iacute;r.</span>
of &#7716;ajj&aacute;j, the dreaded governor of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, and
eulogised his patron in such extravagant terms as
to arouse the jealousy of the Caliph &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik, who
consequently received him, on his appearance at Damascus,
with marked coldness and hauteur. But when, after several
repulses, he at length obtained permission to recite a poem
which he had composed in honour of the prince, and came
to the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i05">
"Are not ye the best of those who on camel ride,</span><span class="i0">

<p>the Caliph sat up erect on his throne and exclaimed: "Let

satirist stood so high that to be worsted by him was reckoned
a greater distinction than to vanquish any one else. The
blind poet, Bashsh&aacute;r b. Burd (&#8224;&nbsp;783 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), said: "I satirised
Jar&iacute;r, but he considered me too young for him to notice.
Had he answered me, I should have been the finest poet
in the world."<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> The following anecdote shows that
vituperation launched by a master like Jar&iacute;r was a deadly
and far-reaching weapon which degraded its victim in the
eyes of his contemporaries, however he might deserve their
esteem, and covered his family and tribe with lasting
disgrace.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was a poet of repute, well known by the name of R&aacute;&#8216;i &#8217;l-ibil
(Camel-herd), who loudly published his opinion that Farazdaq was
superior to Jar&iacute;r, although the latter had lauded his tribe, the Ban&uacute;
Numayr, whereas Farazdaq had made verses against them. One
day Jar&iacute;r met him and expostulated with him but got no reply.
R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; was riding a mule and was accompanied by his son, Jandal,
who said to his father: "Why do you halt before this dog of the
Ban&uacute; Kulayb, as though you had anything to hope or fear from
him?" At the same time he gave the mule a lash with his whip.
The animal started violently and kicked Jar&iacute;r, who was standing by,
so that his cap fell to the ground. R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; took no heed and went on
his way. Jar&iacute;r picked up the cap, brushed it, and replaced it on his
head. Then he exclaimed in verse:&mdash;</p>

<p>He returned home full of indignation, and after the evening prayer,
having called for a jar of date-wine and a lamp, he set about his
work. An old woman in the house heard him muttering, and
mounted the stairs to see what ailed him. She found him crawling
naked on his bed, by reason of that which was within him; so she
ran down, crying "He is mad," and described what she had seen to
the people of the house. "Get thee gone," they said, "we know

what he is at." By daybreak Jar&iacute;r had composed a satire of eighty
verses against the Ban&uacute; Numayr. When he finished the poem, he
shouted triumphantly, "<i>Allah Akbar!</i>" and rode away to the place
where he expected to find R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; &#8217;l-ibil and Farazdaq and their friends.
He did not salute R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; but immediately began to recite. While he
was speaking Farazdaq and R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; bowed their heads, and the rest of
the company sat listening in silent mortification. When Jar&iacute;r uttered
the final words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"<i>Cast down thine eyes for shame! for thou art of</i></span><span class="i0">
<i>Numayr&mdash;no peer of Ka&#8216;b nor yet Kil&aacute;b</i>"&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p>R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; rose and hastened to his lodging as fast as his mule could carry
him. "Saddle! Saddle!" he cried to his comrades; "you cannot
stay here longer, Jar&iacute;r has disgraced you all." They left Ba&#7779;ra without
delay to rejoin their tribe, who bitterly reproached R&aacute;&#8216;&iacute; for the
ignominy which he had brought upon Numayr; and hundreds of
years afterwards his name was still a byword among his people.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></p></div>

<p>Next, but next at a long interval, to the three great poets of
this epoch comes Dhu &#8217;l-Rumma (Ghayl&aacute;n b. &#8216;Uqba), who
<span class="sidenote">Dhu &#8217;l-Rumma.</span>
imitated the odes of the desert Arabs with tiresome
and monotonous fidelity. The philologists
of the following age delighted in his antique and difficult
style, and praised him far above his merits. It was said
that poetry began with Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays and ended with
Dhu &#8217;l-Rumma; which is true in the sense that he is the
last important representative of the pure Bedouin school.</p>

<p class="tb">Concerning the prose writers of the period we can make
only a few general observations, inasmuch as their works
<span class="sidenote">Prose writers of
the Umayyad
period.</span>
have almost entirely perished.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> In this branch
of literature the same secular, non-Mu&#7717;ammadan
spirit prevailed which has been mentioned as
characteristic of the poets who flourished under the Umayyad
dynasty, and of the dynasty itself. Historical studies

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_247" id="Page_247" href="#"><span><i>PROSE WRITERS</i></span>247</a></span>

were encouraged and promoted by the court of Damascus.
We have referred elsewhere to &#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. Sharya, a native of
Yemen, whose business it was to dress up the old legends
and purvey them in a readable form to the public. Another
Yemenite of Persian descent, Wahb b. Munabbih, is responsible
for a great deal of the fabulous lore belonging to the
domain of <i>Aw&aacute;&#8217;il</i> (Origins) which Moslem chroniclers
commonly prefix to their historical works. There seems to
have been an eager demand for narratives of the Early
Wars of Islam (<i>magh&aacute;z&iacute;</i>). It is related that the Caliph
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik, seeing one of these books in the hands of
his son, ordered it to be burnt, and enjoined him to study
the Koran instead. This anecdote shows on the part of
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik a pious feeling with which he is seldom
credited,<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> but it shows also that histories of a legendary
and popular character preceded those which were based,
like the <i>Magh&aacute;z&iacute;</i> of M&uacute;s&aacute; b. &#8216;Uqba (&#8224;&nbsp;758 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and Ibn
Is&#7717;&aacute;q's <i>Biography of the Prophet</i>, upon religious tradition.
No work of the former class has been preserved. The
strong theological influence which asserted itself in the
second century of the Hijra was unfavourable to the development
of an Arabian prose literature on national lines. In
the meantime, however, learned doctors of divinity began
to collect and write down the <i>&#7716;ad&iacute;ths</i>. We have a solitary
relic of this sort in the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Zuhd</i> (Book of Asceticism)
by Asad b. M&uacute;s&aacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;749 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The most renowned
traditionist of the Umayyad age is Mu&#7717;ammad b. Muslim
b. Shih&aacute;b al-Zuhr&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;742 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), who distinguished himself by
accepting judicial office under the tyrants; an act of complaisance
to which his more stiff-necked and conscientious
brethren declined to stoop.</p>

<p class="tb">It was the lust of conquest even more than missionary zeal
that caused the Arabs to invade Syria and Persia and to settle

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_248" id="Page_248" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>248</a></span>

on foreign soil, where they lived as soldiers at the expense of
the native population whom they inevitably regarded as
an inferior race. If the latter thought to win <span class="sidenote"> The non-Arabian
Moslems.</span>
respect by embracing the religion of their conquerors,
they found themselves sadly mistaken.
The new converts were attached as clients (<i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>, sing.
<i>Mawl&aacute;</i>) to an Arab tribe: they could not become Moslems
on any other footing. Far from obtaining the equal rights
which they coveted, and which, according to the principles
of Islam, they should have enjoyed, the <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> were treated
by their aristocratic patrons with contempt, and had to submit
to every kind of social degradation, while instead of being
exempted from the capitation-tax paid by non-Moslems,
they still remained liable to the ever-increasing exactions of
Government officials. And these 'Clients,' be it remembered,
were not ignorant serfs, but men whose culture was
acknowledged by the Arabs themselves&mdash;men who formed
the backbone of the influential learned class and ardently
prosecuted those studies, Divinity and Jurisprudence, which
were then held in highest esteem. Here was a situation
full of danger. Against Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites and Kh&aacute;rijites the Umayyads
might claim with some show of reason to represent the cause
of law and order, if not of Islam; against the bitter cry of the
oppressed <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> they had no argument save the sword.</p>

<p class="tb">We have referred above to the universal belief of Moslems
in a Messiah and to the extraordinary influence of that belief
on their religious and political history. No <span class="sidenote"> Presages of the
Revolution.</span>
wonder that in this unhappy epoch thousands
of people, utterly disgusted with life as they
found it, should have indulged in visions of 'a good time
coming,' which was expected to coincide with the end of
the first century of the Hijra. Mysterious predictions, dark
sayings attributed to Mu&#7717;ammad himself, prophecies of war
and deliverance floated to and fro. Men pored over apocryphal

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_249" id="Page_249" href="#"><span><i>THE MAW&Aacute;L&Iacute; OR 'CLIENTS'</i></span>249</a></span>

books, and asked whether the days of confusion and
slaughter (<i>al-harj</i>), which, it is known, shall herald the
appearance of the Mahd&iacute;, had not actually begun.</p>

<p>The final struggle was short and decisive. When it closed,
the Umayyads and with them the dominion of the Arabs
had passed away. Alike in politics and literature, the Persian
race asserted its supremacy. We shall now relate the story
of this Revolution as briefly as possible, leaving the results
to be considered in a new chapter.</p>

<p>While the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite missionaries (<i>du&#8216;&aacute;t</i>, sing. <i>d&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;</i>) were
actively engaged in canvassing for their party, which, as we
<span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids.</span>
have seen, recognised in &#8216;Al&iacute; and his descendants
the only legitimate successors to Mu&#7717;ammad,
another branch of the Prophet's family&mdash;the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids&mdash;had
entered the field with the secret intention of turning the
labours of the &#8216;Alids to their own advantage. From their
ancestor, &#8216;Abb&aacute;s, the Prophet's uncle, they inherited those
qualities of caution, duplicity, and worldly wisdom which
ensure success in political intrigue. &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h, the son of
&#8216;Abb&aacute;s, devoted his talents to theology and interpretation
of the Koran. He "passes for one of the strongest pillars
of religious tradition; but, in the eyes of unprejudiced
European research, he is only a crafty liar." His descendants
"lived in deep retirement in &#7716;umayma, a little place
to the south of the Dead Sea, seemingly far withdrawn
from the world, but which, on account of its proximity to
the route by which Syrian pilgrims went to Mecca, afforded
opportunities for communication with the remotest lands
of Islam. From this centre they carried on <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
propaganda in
Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n.</span>
the propaganda in their own behalf with the
utmost skill. They had genius enough to see
that the best soil for their efforts was the distant Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n&mdash;that
is, the extensive north-eastern provinces of the old
Persian Empire."<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> These countries were inhabited by a

brave and high-spirited people who in consequence of their
intolerable sufferings under the Umayyad tyranny, the
devastation of their homes and the almost servile condition
to which they had been reduced, were eager to join in any
desperate enterprise that gave them hope of relief. Moreover,
the Arabs in Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n were already to a large extent
Persianised: they had Persian wives, wore trousers, drank
wine, and kept the festivals of Nawr&uacute;z and Mihrg&aacute;n;
while the Persian language was generally understood and
even spoken among them.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> Many interesting details as to
the methods of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid emissaries will be found in
Van Vloten's admirable work.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> Starting from K&uacute;fa, the
residence of the Grand Master who directed the whole
agitation, they went to and fro in the guise of merchants
or pilgrims, cunningly adapting their doctrine to the intelligence
of those whom they sought to enlist. Like the
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, they canvassed for 'the House of the Prophet,' an
ambiguous expression which might equally well be applied
to the descendants of &#8216;Al&iacute; or of &#8216;Abb&aacute;s, as is shown by the
following table:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/288image.png" width="500" height="164" alt=
"descendants of &#8216;Al&iacute; or of &#8216;Abb&aacute;s" title="" /></div>

<p>It was, of course, absolutely essential to the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids that
they should be able to count on the support of the powerful
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite organisation, which, ever since the abortive <span class="sidenote">The Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites
join hands with
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids.</span>
rebellion headed by Mukht&aacute;r (see p. <a href="#Page_218">218</a> <i>supra</i>)
had drawn vast numbers of Persian <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>
into its ranks. Now, of the two main parties of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_251" id="Page_251" href="#"><span><i>THE &#8216;ABB&Aacute;SID PROPAGANDA</i></span>251</a></span>

viz., the H&aacute;shimites or followers of Mu&#7717;ammad Ibnu
&#8217;l-&#7716;anafiyya, and the Im&aacute;mites, who pinned their faith to
the descendants of the Prophet through his daughter F&aacute;&#7789;ima,
the former had virtually identified themselves with the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sids, inasmuch as the Im&aacute;m Ab&uacute; H&aacute;shim, who died
in 716 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, bequeathed his hereditary rights to Mu&#7717;ammad
b. &#8216;Al&iacute;, the head of the House of &#8216;Abb&aacute;s. It only remained
to hoodwink the Im&aacute;mites. Accordingly the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
emissaries were instructed to carry on their propaganda in
the name of H&aacute;shim, the common ancestor of &#8216;Abb&aacute;s and
&#8216;Al&iacute;. By means of this ruse they obtained a free hand in
Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, and made such progress that the governor of that
province, Na&#7779;r b. Sayy&aacute;r, wrote to the Umayyad Caliph,
Marw&aacute;n, asking for reinforcements, and informing him that
two hundred thousand men had sworn allegiance to Ab&uacute;
Muslim, the principal &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid agent. At the foot of his
letter he added these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"I see the coal's red glow beneath the embers,</span><span class="i2">
And 'tis about to blaze!</span><span class="i0">

I cry in sore amaze."<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have other verses by this gallant and loyal officer in
which he implores the Arab troops stationed in Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, who
were paralysed by tribal dissensions, to turn their swords
against "a mixed rabble without religion or nobility":&mdash;</p>

<p>These warnings, however, were of no avail, and on
June 9th, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 747, Ab&uacute; Muslim displayed the black banner

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_252" id="Page_252" href="#"><span><i>THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY</i></span>252</a></span>

of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids at Siqadanj, near Merv, which city he
occupied a few months later. The triumphant advance
of the armies of the Revolution towards <span class="sidenote"> Declaration of
war.</span>
Damascus recalls the celebrated campaign of
C&aelig;sar, when after crossing the Rubicon he
marched on Rome. Nor is Ab&uacute; Muslim, though a freedman
of obscure parentage&mdash;he was certainly no Arab&mdash;unworthy
to be compared with the great patrician. "He
united," says N&ouml;ldeke, "with an agitator's adroitness and
perfect unscrupulosity in the choice of means the energy
and clear outlook of a general and statesman, <span class="sidenote"> Ab&uacute; Muslim.</span>
and even of a monarch."<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> Grim, ruthless,
disdaining the pleasures of ordinary men, he possessed the
faculty in which C&aelig;sar excelled of inspiring blind obedience
and enthusiastic devotion. To complete the parallel, we may
mention here that Ab&uacute; Muslim was treacherously murdered
by Man&#7779;&uacute;r, the second Caliph of the House which he had
raised to the throne, from motives exactly resembling those
which Shakespeare has put in the mouth of Brutus&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The downfall of the Umayyads was hastened by the perfidy
and selfishness of the Arabs on whom they relied: the old
feud between Mu&#7693;ar and Yemen broke out afresh, and while
the Northern group remained loyal to the dynasty, those of
Yemenite stock more or less openly threw in their lot with
the Revolution. We need not attempt to trace the course

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_253" id="Page_253" href="#"><span><i>AB&Uacute; MUSLIM</i></span>253</a></span>

of the unequal contest. Everywhere the Arabs, disheartened
and divided, fell an easy prey to their adversaries, and all was
lost when Marw&aacute;n, the last Umayyad Caliph, sustained a
crushing defeat on the River Z&aacute;b in Babylonia (January,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 750). Meanwhile Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s, the head of the
rival House, had already received homage as Caliph
(November, 749 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). In the inaugural address which he
delivered in the great Mosque of K&uacute;fa, he called <span class="sidenote">Accession of
Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s
al-Saff&aacute;&#7717;.</span>
himself <i>al-Saff&aacute;&#7717;</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, 'the Blood-shedder,'<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> and
this title has deservedly stuck to him, though
it might have been assumed with no less justice by his
brother Mans&uacute;r and other members of his family. All
Umayyads were remorselessly hunted down and massacred
in cold blood&mdash;even those who surrendered only on the
strength of the most solemn pledges that they had nothing
to fear. A small remnant made their escape, or managed
to find shelter until the storm of fury and vengeance,
which spared neither the dead nor the living,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> had blown
over. One stripling, named &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n, fled to North
Africa, and after meeting with many perilous adventures
founded a new Umayyad dynasty in Spain.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>

<h5>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</h5>

<p>The annals of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid dynasty from the accession of
Saff&aacute;&#7717; (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 749) to the death of Musta&#8216;&#7779;im, and the destruction
of Baghd&aacute;d by the Mongols (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1258) make a round
sum of five centuries. I propose to sketch the history of this
long period in three chapters, of which the first will offer a
general view of the more important literary and political
developments so far as is possible in the limited space at my
command; the second will be devoted to the great poets,
scholars, historians, philosophers, and scientists who flourished
in this, the Golden Age of Mu&#7717;ammadan literature; while in
the third some account will be given of the chief religious
movements and of the trend of religious thought.</p>

<p class="tb">The empire founded by the Caliph &#8216;Umar and administered
by the Umayyads was essentially, as the reader will have
gathered, a military organisation for the benefit of the
paramount race. In theory, no doubt, all Moslems were
equal, but in fact the Arabs alone ruled&mdash;a privilege which
national pride conspired with personal interest to maintain.
We have seen how the Persian Moslems asserted their right
to a share in the government. The Revolution <span class="sidenote"> Political results
of the
Revolution.</span>
which enthroned the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids marks the beginning
of a Moslem, as opposed to an Arabian,
Empire. The new dynasty, owing its rise to the people of
Persia, and especially of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, could exist only by

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_255" id="Page_255" href="#"><span><i>&#8216;ABB&Aacute;SID POLICY</i></span>255</a></span>

establishing a balance of power between Persians and Arabs.
That this policy was not permanently successful will surprise
no one who considers the widely diverse characteristics of the
two races, but for the next fifty years the rivals worked
together in tolerable harmony, thanks to the genius of
Man&#7779;&uacute;r and the conciliatory influence of the Barmecides,
by whose overthrow the alliance was virtually dissolved. In
the ensuing civil war between the sons of H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d
the Arabs fought on the side of Am&iacute;n while the Persians
supported Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n, and henceforth each race began to follow
an independent path. The process of separation, however,
was very gradual, and long before it was completed the
religious and intellectual life of both nationalities had
become inseparably mingled in the full stream of Moslem
civilisation.</p>

<p class="tb">The centre of this civilisation was the province of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q
(Babylonia), with its renowned metropolis, Baghd&aacute;d, 'the
<span class="sidenote"> The choice of a
new capital.</span>
City of Peace' (<i>Mad&iacute;natu &#8217;l-Sal&aacute;m</i>). Only here
could the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids feel themselves at home.
"Damascus, peopled by the dependants of the
Omayyads, was out of the question. On the one hand it
was too far from Persia, whence the power of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids
was chiefly derived; on the other hand it was dangerously
near the Greek frontier, and from here, during the troublous
reigns of the last Omayyads, hostile incursions on the part of
the Christians had begun to avenge former defeats. It was
also beginning to be evident that the conquests of Islam
would, in the future, lie to the eastward towards Central
Asia, rather than to the westward at the further expense of
the Byzantines. Damascus, on the highland of Syria, lay, so
to speak, dominating the Mediterranean and looking westward,
but the new capital that was to supplant it must face
east, be near Persia, and for the needs of commerce have water
communication with the sea. Hence everything pointed to a

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_256" id="Page_256" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>256</a></span>

site on either the Euphrates or the Tigris, and the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids
were not slow to make their choice."<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> After carefully
examining various sites, the Caliph Man&#7779;&uacute;r fixed on a little
Persian village, on the west bank of the Tigris, called
Baghd&aacute;d, which, being interpreted, means <span class="sidenote"> Foundation of
Baghd&aacute;d.</span>
'given (or 'founded') by God'; and in
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 762 the walls of the new city began to
rise. Man&#7779;&uacute;r laid the first brick with his own hand, and
the work was pushed forward with astonishing rapidity under
his personal direction by masons, architects, and surveyors,
whom he gathered out of different countries, so that 'the
Round City,' as he planned it, was actually finished within
the short space of four years.</p>

<p class="tb">The same circumstances which caused the seat of empire
to be transferred to Baghd&aacute;d brought about a corresponding
change in the whole system of government. Whereas the
Umayyads had been little more than heads of a turbulent
Arabian aristocracy, their successors reverted to the old type
of Oriental despotism with which the Persians had been
familiar since the days of Darius and Xerxes. Surrounded
by a strong bodyguard of troops from Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, on whose
devotion they could rely, the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids ruled <span class="sidenote">Despotic
character of
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid rule.</span>
with absolute authority over the lives and properties
or their subjects, even as the S&aacute;s&aacute;nian
monarchs had ruled before them. Persian fashions were
imitated at the court, which was thronged with the Caliph's
relatives and freedmen (not to mention his womenfolk), besides
a vast array of uniformed and decorated officials. Chief amongst
these latter stood two personages who figure prominently in
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>&mdash;the Vizier and the Executioner. The
office of Vizier is probably of Persian origin, although in Professor
De Goeje's opinion the word itself is Arabic.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> The first

was the duty of the Vizier to act as intermediary
between the omnipotent sovereign and his people,
to counsel him in affairs of State, and, above all, to keep His
Majesty in good humour. He wielded enormous power, but
was exposed to every sort of intrigue, and never knew when
he might be interned in a dungeon or despatched in the
twinkling of an eye by the grim functionary presiding over
the <i>na&#7789;&#8216;</i>, or circular carpet of leather, which lay beside the

<p>Cruel and treacherous, like most of his family, Ab&uacute; Ja&#8216;far
Man&#7779;&uacute;r was perhaps the greatest ruler whom the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids

produced.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> He had to fight hard for his throne.
The &#8216;Alids, who deemed themselves the true
heirs of the Prophet in virtue of their descent
from F&aacute;&#7789;ima, rose in rebellion against the usurper, surprised
him in an unguarded moment, and drove him to such straits
that during seven weeks he never changed his dress except for
public prayers. But once more the &#8216;Alids proved incapable
of grasping their opportunity. The leaders, Mu&#7717;ammad, who
was known as 'The Pure Soul' (<i>al-Nafs al-zakiyya</i>), and his
brother Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m, fell on the battle-field. Under Mahd&iacute; <span class="sidenote"> Outbreaks in
Persia.</span>
and H&aacute;r&uacute;n members of the House of &#8216;Al&iacute; continued to
'come out,' but with no better success. In Eastern Persia,
where strong national feelings interwove themselves with
Pre-Mu&#7717;ammadan religious ideas, those of Mazdak and
Zoroaster in particular, the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids encountered a formidable
opposition which proclaimed its vigour
and tenacity by the successive revolts of Sinb&aacute;dh
the Magian (755-756 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), Ust&aacute;dhs&iacute;s (766-768),
Muqanna&#8216;, the 'Veiled Prophet of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n' (780-786),
and B&aacute;bak the Khurramite (816-838).<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></p>

<p>Man&#7779;&uacute;r said to his son Mahdi, "O Ab&uacute; &#8216;Abdall&aacute;h, when
you sit in company, always have divines to converse with you;
<span class="sidenote"> Man&#7779;&uacute;r's advice

dislike it'; and he spoke the truth."<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></p>

<p>On one occasion a poet came to Mahd&iacute;, who was then
heir-apparent, at Rayy, and recited a panegyric in his honour.

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_259" id="Page_259" href="#"><span><i>MAN&#7778;&Uacute;R</i></span>259</a></span>

The prince gave him 20,000 dirhems. Thereupon the
postmaster of Rayy informed Man&#7779;&uacute;r, who wrote to his son
<span class="sidenote"> Man&#7779;&uacute;r and
the poet.</span>
reproaching him for such extravagance. "What
you should have done," he said, "was to let him
wait a year at your door, and after that time
bestow on him 4,000 dirhems." He then caused the poet
to be arrested and brought into his presence. "You went
to a heedless youth and cajoled him?" "Yes, God save
the Commander of the Faithful, I went to a heedless,
generous youth and cajoled him, and he suffered himself to
be cajoled." "Recite your eulogy of him." The poet
obeyed, not forgetting to conclude his verses with a compliment
to Man&#7779;&uacute;r. "Bravo!" cried the Caliph, "but they
are not worth 20,000 dirhems. Where is the money?" On
its being produced he made him a gift of 4,000 dirhems and
confiscated the remainder.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding irreconcilable parties&mdash;&#8216;Alids, Persian
extremists, and (we may add) Kh&aacute;rijites&mdash;the policy of
<span class="sidenote"> The Barmecides.</span>
<i>rapprochement</i> was on the whole extraordinarily
effective. In carrying it out the Caliphs received
powerful assistance from a noble and ancient Persian
family, the celebrated Barmakites or Barmecides. According
to Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> Barmak was originally a title borne by the High
Priest (<i>s&aacute;din</i>) of the great Magian fire-temple at Balkh.
Kh&aacute;lid, the son of one of these dignitaries&mdash;whence he and
his descendants were called Barmakites (<i>Bar&aacute;mika</i>)&mdash;held the
most important offices of state under Saff&aacute;&#7717; and Man&#7779;&uacute;r.
Ya&#7717;y&aacute;, the son of Kh&aacute;lid, was entrusted with the education
of H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d, and on the accession of the young
prince he was appointed Grand Vizier. "My <span class="sidenote"> Ya&#7717;y&aacute; b. Kh&aacute;lid.</span>
dear father!" said the Caliph, "it is through
the blessings and the good fortune which attend you, and
through your excellent management, that I am seated on the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_260" id="Page_260" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>260</a></span>
throne;<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> so I commit to you the direction of affairs." He then
handed to him his signet-ring. Ya&#7717;y&aacute; was distinguished (says
the biographer) for wisdom, nobleness of mind, and elegance of
language.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> Although he took a truly Persian delight in philosophical
discussion, for which purpose freethinking scholars
and eminent heretics used often to meet in his house, he was
careful to observe the outward forms of piety. It may be said
of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids generally that, whatever they might do or
think in private, they wore the official badge of Islam ostentatiously
on their sleeves. The following verses which Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
addressed to his son Fa&#7693;l are very characteristic:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<p>H&aacute;r&uacute;n's orthodoxy, his liberality, his victories over the
Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus, and last but not least the
literary brilliance of his reign have raised him in popular
estimation far above all the other Caliphs: he is the Charlemagne
of the East, while the entrancing pages of the <i>Thousand
and One Nights</i> have made his name a household word in every
country of Europe. Students of Moslem history will soon
discover that "the good Haroun Alraschid" was <span class="sidenote">H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d
(786-809 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
in fact a perfidious and irascible tyrant, whose
fitful amiability and real taste for music and
letters hardly entitle him to be described either as a great
monarch or a good man. We must grant, however, that he
thoroughly understood the noble art of patronage. The
poets Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya, Di&#8216;bil, Muslim b. Wal&iacute;d,
and &#8216;Abb&aacute;s b. A&#7717;naf; the musician Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m of Mosul and
his son Is&#7717;&aacute;q; the philologists Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda, A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute;, and
Kis&aacute;&#8217;&iacute;; the preacher Ibnu &#8217;l-Samm&aacute;k; and the historian
W&aacute;qid&iacute;&mdash;these are but a few names in the galaxy of talent
which he gathered around him at Baghd&aacute;d.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_262" id="Page_262" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>262</a></span></p>

<p>The fall of the Barmecides revived the spirit of racial
antagonism which they had done their best to lay, and an
<span class="sidenote">Am&iacute;n and
Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n
(809-833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
open rupture was rendered inevitable by the
short-sighted policy of H&aacute;r&uacute;n with regard to
the succession. He had two grown-up sons,
Am&iacute;n, by his wife and cousin Zubayda, and Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n, whose
mother was a Persian slave. It was arranged that the
Caliphate should pass to Am&iacute;n and after him to his brother,
but that the Empire should be divided between them. Am&iacute;n
was to receive &#8216;Ir&aacute;q and Syria, Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n the eastern provinces,
where the people would gladly welcome a ruler of
their own blood. The struggle for supremacy which began
almost immediately on the death of H&aacute;r&uacute;n was in the main
one of Persians against Arabs, and by Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n's triumph the
Barmecides were amply avenged.</p>

<p>The new Caliph was anything but orthodox. He favoured
the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite party to such an extent that he even nominated
the &#8216;Alid, &#8216;Al&iacute; b. M&uacute;s&aacute; b. Ja&#8216;far al-Ri&#7693;&aacute;, as heir-apparent&mdash;a
step which alienated the members of <span class="sidenote"> Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n's
heresies.</span>
his own family and led to his being temporarily
deposed. He also adopted the opinions of the Mu&#8216;tazilite sect
and established an Inquisition to enforce them. Hence the
Sunnite historian, Abu &#8217;l-Ma&#7717;&aacute;sin, enumerates three principal
heresies of which Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n was guilty: (1) His wearing of the
Green (<i>labsu &#8217;l-Khu&#7693;ra</i>)<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> and courting the &#8216;Alids and repulsing
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids; (2) his affirming that the Koran was created
(<i>al-qawl bi-Khalqi &#8217;l-Qur&#8217;&aacute;n</i>); and (3) his legalisation of the
<i>mut&#8216;a</i>, a loose form of marriage prevailing amongst the
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> We shall see in due course how keenly and with
what fruitful results Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n interested himself in literature
and science. Nevertheless, it cannot escape our attention
that in this splendid reign there appear ominous signs of political
decay. In 822 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> &#7788;&aacute;hir, one of Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n's generals, who

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_263" id="Page_263" href="#"><span><i>MA&#8217;M&Uacute;N</i></span>263</a></span>

had been appointed governor of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, omitted the
customary mention of the Caliph's name from the Friday
sermon (<i>khu&#7789;ba</i>), thus founding the &#7788;ahirid <span class="sidenote"> Rise of
independent
dynasties.</span>
dynasty, which, though professing allegiance to
the Caliphs, was practically independent. &#7788;&aacute;hir
was only the first of a long series of ambitious governors and
bold adventurers who profited by the weakening authority of
the Caliphs to carve out kingdoms for themselves. Moreover,
the Moslems of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q had lost their old warlike spirit: they
were fine scholars and merchants, but poor soldiers. So it
came about that Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n's successor, the Caliph Mu&#8216;ta&#7779;im
(833-842 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), took the fatal step of surrounding
himself with a Pr&aelig;torian Guard chiefly<span class="sidenote"> Turkish
mercenaries
introduced.</span>
composed of Turkish recruits from Transoxania.
At the same time he removed his court from Baghd&aacute;d sixty
miles further up the Tigris to S&aacute;marr&aacute;, which suddenly grew
into a superb city of palaces and barracks&mdash;an Oriental Versailles.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a>
Here we may close our brief review of the first and
flourishing period of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphate. During the
next four centuries the Caliphs come and go faster than
ever, but for the most part their authority is precarious, if
not purely nominal. Meanwhile, in the provinces of the
Empire petty dynasties arise, only to eke out <span class="sidenote"> Decline of the
Caliphate.</span>
an obscure and troubled existence, or powerful
states are formed, which carry on the traditions
of Mu&#7717;ammadan culture, it may be through many generations,
and in some measure restore the blessings of peace and
settled government to an age surfeited with anarchy and
bloodshed. Of these provincial empires we have now principally
to speak, confining our view, for the most part, to the
political outlines, and reserving the literary and religious
aspects of the period for fuller consideration elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_264" id="Page_264" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>264</a></span>

The reigns of Mutawakkil (847-861 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and his immediate
successors exhibit all the well-known features of Pr&aelig;torian rule.
<span class="sidenote">The Second
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Period
(847-1258 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Enormous sums were lavished on the Turkish
soldiery, who elected and deposed the Caliph just
as they pleased, and enforced their insatiable
demands by mutiny and assassination. For a short time
(869-907 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) matters improved under the able and energetic
Muhtad&iacute; and the four Caliphs who followed him; but the
Turks soon regained the upper hand. From this date every
vestige of real power is centred in the Generalissimo (<i>Am&iacute;ru
&#8217;l-Umar&aacute;</i>) who stands at the head of the army, while the
once omnipotent Caliph must needs be satisfied with the
empty honour of having his name stamped on the coinage
and celebrated in the public prayers. The terrorism of the
Turkish bodyguard was broken by the Buwayhids, a Persian
dynasty, who ruled in Baghd&aacute;d from 945 to 1055 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Then
the Selj&uacute;q supremacy began with &#7788;ughril Beg's entry into the
capital and lasted a full century until the death of Sanjar
(1157 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The Mongols who captured Baghd&aacute;d in
1258 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> brought the pitiable farce of the Caliphate to
an end.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The empire of the Caliphs at its widest," as Stanley Lane-Poole
observes in his excellent account of the Mu&#7717;ammadan dynasties,
<span class="sidenote">Dynasties of the

Age.</span>
"extended from the Atlantic to the Indus, and from
the Caspian to the cataracts of the Nile. So vast a
dominion could not long be held together. The first
step towards its disintegration began in Spain, where &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n,
a member of the suppressed Umayyad family, was acknowledged
as an independent sovereign in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 755, and the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
Caliphate was renounced for ever. Thirty years later Idr&iacute;s, a
great-grandson of the Caliph &#8216;Al&iacute;, and therefore equally at variance
with &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids and Umayyads, founded an &#8216;Alid dynasty in
Morocco. The rest of the North African coast was practically lost
to the Caliphate when the Aghlabid governor established his
authority at Qayraw&aacute;n in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 800."</p></div>

<p>Amongst the innumerable kingdoms which supplanted the

Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, which was then held by the
&#7788;&aacute;hirids, fell into the hands of Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b b. Layth
the Coppersmith (<i>al-&#7778;aff&aacute;r</i>), founder of the &#7778;aff&aacute;rids, who for
thirty years stretched their sway over a great part of Persia,
until they were dispossessed by the S&aacute;m&aacute;nids.
The latter dynasty had the seat of its power in
Transoxania, but during the first half of the<span class="sidenote">The S&aacute;m&aacute;nids
(874-999 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
tenth century practically the whole of Persia submitted to the
authority of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l and his famous successors, Na&#7779;r II and
N&uacute;&#7717; I. Not only did these princes warmly encourage and
foster the development, which had already begun, of a national
literature in the Persian language&mdash;it is enough to recall here
the names of R&uacute;dag&iacute;, the blind minstrel and poet; Daq&iacute;q&iacute;,
whose fragment of a Persian Epic was afterwards incorporated
by Firdaws&iacute; in his <i>Sh&aacute;hn&aacute;ma</i>; and Bal&#8216;am&iacute;, the Vizier of
Man&#7779;&uacute;r I, who composed an abridgment of &#7788;abar&iacute;'s great
history, which is one of the oldest prose works in Persian that
have come down to us&mdash;but they extended the same favour to
poets and men of learning who (though, for the most part, of
Persian extraction) preferred to use the Arabic language.
Thus the celebrated Rhazes (Ab&uacute; Bakr al-R&aacute;z&iacute;) dedicated to
the S&aacute;m&aacute;nid prince Ab&uacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; Man&#7779;&uacute;r b. Ish&aacute;q a treatise on
medicine, which he entitled <i>al-Kit&aacute;b al-Man&#7779;&uacute;r&iacute;</i> (the Book of
Man&#7779;&uacute;r) in honour of his patron. The great physician and
philosopher, Ab&uacute; &#8216;Al&iacute; b. S&iacute;n&aacute; (Avicenna) relates that, having
been summoned to Bukh&aacute;r&aacute; by King N&uacute;&#7717;, the second of that
name (976-997 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), he obtained permission to visit the

royal library. "I found there," he says, "many rooms filled
with books which were arranged in cases row upon row. One
room was allotted to works on Arabic philology and poetry;
another to jurisprudence, and so forth, the books on each particular
science having a room to themselves. I inspected the
catalogue of ancient Greek authors and looked for the books
which I required: I saw in this collection books of which few
people have heard even the names, and which I myself have
never seen either before or since."<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p>The power of the S&aacute;m&aacute;nids quickly reached its zenith, and
about the middle of the tenth century they were confined to
<span class="sidenote">The Buwayhids
(932-1055 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n and Transoxania, while in Western
Persia their place was taken by the Buwayhids.
Ab&uacute; Shuj&aacute;&#8216; Buwayh, a chieftain of Daylam, the
mountainous province lying along the southern shores of the
Caspian Sea, was one of those soldiers of fortune whom we
meet with so frequently in the history of this period. His three
sons, &#8216;Al&iacute;, A&#7717;mad, and &#7716;asan, embarked on the same adventurous
career with such energy and success, that in the course
of thirteen years they not only subdued the provinces of F&aacute;rs
and Kh&uacute;zist&aacute;n, but in 945 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> entered Baghd&aacute;d at the head
of their Daylamite troops and assumed the supreme command,
receiving from the Caliph Mustakf&iacute; the honorary titles of
&#8216;Im&aacute;du &#8217;l-Dawla, Mu&#8216;izzu &#8217;l-Dawla, and Ruknu &#8217;l-Dawla.
Among the princes of this House, who reigned over Persia and
&#8216;Ir&aacute;q during the next hundred years, the most eminent was
&#8216;A&#7693;udu &#8217;l-Dawla, of whom it is said by Ibn Khallik&aacute;n that
none of the Buwayhids, notwithstanding their great power
and authority, possessed so extensive an empire and held sway
over so many kings and kingdoms as he. The chief poets
of the day, including Mutanabb&iacute;, visited his court at Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z
and celebrated his praises in magnificent odes. He also built
a great hospital in Baghd&aacute;d, the B&iacute;m&aacute;rist&aacute;n al-&#8216;A&#7693;ud&iacute;, which

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_267" id="Page_267" href="#"><span><i>THE BUWAYHIDS</i></span>267</a></span>

was long famous as a school of medicine. The Viziers of the
Buwayhid family contributed in a quite unusual degree to its
literary renown. Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Am&iacute;d, the Vizier of Ruknu &#8217;l-Dawla,
surpassed in philology and epistolary composition all his
contemporaries; hence he was called 'the second J&aacute;&#7717;i&#7827;,' and
it was a common saying that "the art of letter-writing began
with &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-&#7716;am&iacute;d and ended with Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Am&iacute;d."<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a>
His friend, the &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ib Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l b. &#8216;Abb&aacute;d, Vizier to Mu&#8217;ayyidu
&#8217;l-Dawla and Fakhru &#8217;l-Dawla, was a distinguished savant,
whose learning was only eclipsed by the liberality of his
patronage. In the latter respect S&aacute;b&uacute;r b. Ardash&iacute;r, the prime
minister of Ab&uacute; Na&#7779;r Bah&aacute;&#8217;u &#8217;l-Dawla, vied with the illustrious
&#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ib. He had so many encomiasts that Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; devotes to
them a whole chapter of the <i>Yat&iacute;ma</i>. The Academy which
he founded at Baghd&aacute;d, in the Karkh quarter, and generously
endowed, was a favourite haunt of literary men, and its
members seem to have enjoyed pretty much the same privileges
as belong to the Fellows of an Oxford or Cambridge
College.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></p>

<p>Like most of their countrymen, the Buwayhids were
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites in religion. We read in the Annals of Abu &#8217;l-Ma&#7717;&aacute;sin
under the year 341 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 952 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In this year the Vizier al-Muhallab&iacute; arrested some persons
who held the doctrine of metempsychosis (<i>tan&aacute;sukh</i>). Among

woman who claimed that the spirit of F&aacute;&#7789;ima was
dwelling in her; while another man pretended to be Gabriel. On
being flogged, they excused themselves by alleging their relationship
to the Family of the Prophet, whereupon Mu&#8216;izzu &#8217;l-Dawla ordered
them to be set free. This he did because of his attachment to

Sh&iacute;&#8216;ism. It is well known," says the author in conclusion, "that the
Buwayhids were Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites and R&aacute;fi&#7693;ites."<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></p></div>

<p>Three dynasties contemporary with the Buwayhids have
still to be mentioned: the Ghaznevids in Afghanistan, the
<span class="sidenote">The Ghaznevids
(976-1186 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
&#7716;amd&aacute;nids in Syria, and the F&aacute;&#7789;imids in Egypt.
Sabuktag&iacute;n, the founder of the first-named
dynasty, was a Turkish slave. His son, Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d,
who succeeded to the throne of Ghazna in 998 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, made
short work of the already tottering S&aacute;m&aacute;nids, and then sweeping
far and wide over Northern India, began a series of conquests
which, before his death in 1030 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, reached from
Lahore to Samarcand and I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. Although the Persian and
Transoxanian provinces of his huge empire were soon torn
away by the Selj&uacute;qs, Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d's invasion of India, which was
undertaken with the object of winning that country for Islam,
permanently established Mu&#7717;ammadan influence, at any rate
in the Panj&aacute;b. As regards their religious views, the Turkish
Ghaznevids stand in sharp contrast with the Persian houses of
S&aacute;m&aacute;n and Buwayh. It has been well said that the true
genius of the Turks lies in action, not in speculation. When
Islam came across their path, they saw that it was a simple
and practical creed such as the soldier requires; so they
accepted it without further parley. The Turks have always
remained loyal to Islam, the Islam of Ab&uacute; Bakr and &#8216;Umar,
which is a very different thing from the Islam of Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite
Persia. Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d proved his orthodoxy by banishing the
Mu&#8216;tazilites of Rayy and burning their books together with
the philosophical and astronomical works that fell into his
hands; but on the same occasion he carried off a hundred
camel-loads of presumably harmless literature to his capital.
That he had no deep enthusiasm for letters is shown, for

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_269" id="Page_269" href="#"><span><i>GHAZNEVIDS AND &#7716;AMD&Aacute;NIDS</i></span>269</a></span>

example, by his shabby treatment of the poet Firdaws&iacute;.
Nevertheless, he ardently desired the glory and prestige
accruing to a sovereign whose court formed the rallying-point
of all that was best in the literary and scientific culture of the
day, and such was Ghazna in the eleventh century. Besides
the brilliant group of Persian poets, with Firdaws&iacute; at their
head, we may mention among the Arabic-writing authors
who flourished under this dynasty the historians al-&#8216;Utb&iacute; and
al-B&iacute;r&uacute;n&iacute;.</p>

<p>While the Eastern Empire of Islam was passing into the
hands of Persians and Turks, we find the Arabs still holding
<span class="sidenote">The &#7716;amd&aacute;nids
(929-1003 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
their own in Syria and Mesopotamia down to
the end of the tenth century. These Arab and
generally nomadic dynasties were seldom of much
account. The &#7716;amd&aacute;nids of Aleppo alone deserve to be
noticed here, and that chiefly for the sake of the peerless
Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla, a worthy descendant of the tribe of Taghlib,
which in the days of heathendom produced the poet-warrior,
&#8216;Amr b. Kulth&uacute;m. &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. &#7716;amd&aacute;n was appointed
governor of Mosul and its dependencies by the Caliph
Muktaf&iacute; in 905 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and in 942 his sons &#7716;asan and &#8216;Al&iacute;
received the complimentary titles of N&aacute;&#7779;iru &#8217;l-Dawla (Defender
of the State) and Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla (Sword of the State).
Two years later Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla captured Aleppo and brought
the whole of Northern Syria under his dominion. During a
reign of twenty-three years he was continuously engaged in
harrying the Byzantines on the frontiers of Asia Minor, but
although he gained some glorious victories, which his laureate
Mutanabb&iacute; has immortalised, the fortune of war went in the
long run steadily against him, and his successors were unable
to preserve their little kingdom from being crushed between the
Byzantines in the north and the F&aacute;&#7789;timids in the south. The
&#7716;amd&aacute;nids have an especial claim on our sympathy, because
they revived for a time the fast-decaying and already almost
broken spirit of Arabian nationalism. It is this spirit that
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_270" id="Page_270" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>270</a></span>
speaks with a powerful voice in Mutanabb&iacute; and declares itself,
for example, in such verses as these:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Men from their kings alone their worth derive,</span><span class="i0">
But Arabs ruled by aliens cannot thrive:</span><span class="i0">

Who know not loyalty and honour's name.</span><span class="i0">

</div></div>

<p>The reputation which Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla's martial exploits and
his repeated triumphs over the enemies of Islam richly earned
<span class="sidenote">The circle of
Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla.</span>
for him in the eyes of his contemporaries was
enhanced by the conspicuous energy and munificence
with which he cultivated the arts of peace.
Considering the brevity of his reign and the relatively small
extent of his resources, we may well be astonished to contemplate
the unique assemblage of literary talent then
mustered in Aleppo. There was, first of all, Mutanabb&iacute;, in
the opinion of his countrymen the greatest of Moslem poets;
there was Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla's cousin, the chivalrous Ab&uacute; Fir&aacute;s,
whose war-songs are relieved by many a touch of tender and
true feeling; there was Abu &#8217;l-Faraj of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, who on
presenting to Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla his <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, one of the
most celebrated and important works in all Arabic literature,
received one thousand pieces of gold accompanied with an
expression of regret that the prince was obliged to remunerate
him so inadequately; there was also the great philosopher,
Ab&uacute; Na&#7779;r al-F&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute;, whose modest wants were satisfied by a
daily pension of four dirhems (about two shillings) from the
public treasury. Surely this is a record not easily surpassed
even in the heyday of &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid patronage. As for the writers
of less note whom Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla attracted to Aleppo, their
name is legion. Space must be found for the poets Sar&iacute; al-Raff&aacute;,
Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s al-N&aacute;m&iacute;, and Abu &#8217;l-Faraj al-Babbagh&aacute;
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_271" id="Page_271" href="#"><span><i>SAYFU &#8217;L-DAWLA</i></span>271</a></span>
for the preacher (<i>kha&#7789;&iacute;b</i>) Ibn Nub&aacute;ta, who would often rouse
the enthusiasm of his audience while he urged the duty of
zealously prosecuting the Holy War against Christian Byzantium;
and for the philologist Ibn Kh&aacute;lawayh, whose lectures
were attended by students from all parts of the Mu&#7717;ammadan
world. The literary renaissance which began at this time
in Syria was still making its influence felt when Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;
wrote his <i>Yat&iacute;ma</i>, about thirty years after the death of Sayfu
&#8217;l-Dawla, and it produced in Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute; (born
973 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) an original and highly interesting personality, to
whom we shall return on another occasion.</p>

<p class="tb">The dynasties hitherto described were political in their
origin, having generally been founded by ambitious governors
<span class="sidenote">The F&aacute;&#7789;imids
(909-1171 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
or vassals. These upstarts made no pretensions
to the nominal authority, which they left in
the hands of the Caliph even while they forced
him at the sword's point to recognise their political independence.
The S&aacute;m&aacute;nids and Buwayhids, Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites as they
were, paid the same homage to the Caliph in Baghd&aacute;d as
did the Sunnite Ghaznevids. But in the beginning of the
tenth century there arose in Africa a great Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite power,
that of the F&aacute;&#7789;imids, who took for themselves the title
and prerogatives of the Caliphate, which they asserted to
be theirs by right Divine. This event was only the
climax of a deep-laid and skilfully organised plot&mdash;one of
the most extraordinary in all history. It had been put in
train half a century earlier by a certain &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h the son
of Maym&uacute;n, a Persian oculist (<i>qadd&aacute;&#7717;</i>) belonging to A&#7717;w&aacute;z.
Filled with a fierce hatred of the Arabs and with a freethinker's
contempt for Islam, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Maym&uacute;n conceived
the idea of a vast secret society which should be all
things to all men, and which, by playing on the strongest
passions and tempting the inmost weaknesses of human
nature, should unite malcontents of every description in a

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_272" id="Page_272" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>272</a></span>

conspiracy to overthrow the existing <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. Modern
readers may find a parallel for this romantic project in the
pages of Dumas, although the Aramis of <i>Twenty Years After</i>
is a simpleton beside &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h. He saw that the movement,
in order to succeed, must be started on a religious basis, and
he therefore identified himself with an obscure <span class="sidenote">The Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;lite
propaganda.</span>
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite sect, the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s, who were so called
because they regarded Mu&#7717;ammad, son of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l,
son of Ja&#8216;far al-&#7778;&aacute;diq, as the Seventh Im&aacute;m. Under &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h
the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s developed their mystical and antinomian doctrines,
of which an excellent account has been given by
Professor Browne in the first volume of his <i>Literary History of
Persia</i> (p. 405 sqq.). Here we can only refer to the ingenious
and fatally insidious methods which he devised for gaining
proselytes on a gigantic scale, and with such amazing success
that from this time until the Mongol invasion&mdash;a period of
almost four centuries&mdash;the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;lites (F&aacute;&#7789;imids, Carmathians,
and Assassins) either ruled or ravaged a great part of the
Mu&#7717;ammadan Empire. It is unnecessary to discuss the
question whether &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Maym&uacute;n was, as Professor
Browne thinks, primarily a religious enthusiast, or whether,
according to the view commonly held, his real motives were
patriotism and personal ambition. The history of Islam
shows clearly enough that the revolutionist is nearly always
disguised as a religious leader, while, on the other hand,
every founder of a militant sect is potentially the head of a
state. &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h may have been a fanatic first and a politician
afterwards; more probably he was both at once from the
beginning. His plan of operations was briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>d&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;</i> or missionary charged with the task of gaining adherents
for the Hidden Im&aacute;m (see p. <a href="#Page_216">216</a> seq.), in whose name allegiance was
demanded, would settle in some place, representing himself to be a
merchant, &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, or the like. By renouncing worldly pleasures,
making a show of strict piety, and performing apparent miracles, it
was easy for him to pass as a saint with the common folk. As soon

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_273" id="Page_273" href="#"><span><i>THE ISM&Aacute;&#8216;&Iacute;L&Iacute;S</i></span>273</a></span>

as he was assured of his neighbours' confidence and respect, he
began to raise doubts in their minds. He would suggest difficult
problems of theology or dwell on the mysterious significance
of certain passages of the Koran. May there not be (he would ask)
in religion itself a deeper meaning than appears on the surface?
Then, having excited the curiosity of his hearers, he suddenly breaks
off. When pressed to continue his explanation, he declares that
such mysteries cannot be communicated save to those who take a
binding oath of secrecy and obedience and consent to pay a fixed
sum of money in token of their good faith. If these conditions
were accepted, the neophyte entered upon the second of the nine
degrees of initiation. He was taught that mere observance of the
laws of Islam is not pleasing to God, unless the true doctrine be
received through the Im&aacute;ms who have it in keeping. These Im&aacute;ms
(as he next learned) are seven in number, beginning with &#8216;Al&iacute;; the
seventh and last is Mu&#7717;ammad, son of Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l. On reaching the
fourth degree he definitely ceased to be a Moslem, for here he was
taught the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;lite system of theology in which Mu&#7717;ammad b.
Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l supersedes the founder of Islam as the greatest and last of
all the Prophets. Comparatively few initiates advanced beyond
this grade to a point where every form of positive religion was
allegorised away, and only philosophy was left. "It is clear what
a tremendous weapon, or rather machine, was thus created. Each
man was given the amount of light which he could bear and which
was suited to his prejudices, and he was made to believe that the
end of the whole work would be the attaining of what he regarded
as most desirable."<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> Moreover, the Im&aacute;m Mu&#7717;ammad b. Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l
having disappeared long ago, the veneration which sought a visible
object was naturally transferred to his successor and representative
on earth, viz., &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Maym&uacute;n, who filled the same office in
relation to him as Aaron to Moses and &#8216;Al&iacute; to Mu&#7717;ammad.</p></div>

<p>About the middle of the ninth century the state of the
Moslem Empire was worse, if possible, than it had been in the
latter days of Umayyad rule. The peasantry of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q were
impoverished by the desolation into which that flourishing
province was beginning to fall in consequence of the frequent
and prolonged civil wars. In 869 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> the negro slaves (<i>Zanj</i>)
employed in the saltpetre industry, for which Ba&#7779;ra was
famous, took up arms at the call of an &#8216;Alid Messiah, and
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_274" id="Page_274" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>274</a></span>
during fourteen years carried fire and sword through Kh&uacute;zist&aacute;n
and the adjacent territory. We can imagine that all this
misery and discontent was a godsend to the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;lites. The
old cry, "A deliverer of the Prophet's House," which served
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids so well against the Umayyads, was now raised
with no less effect against the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids themselves.</p>

<p>&#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Maym&uacute;n died in 875 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, but the agitation
went on, and rapidly gathered force. One of the leading
spirits was &#7716;amd&aacute;n Qarma&#7789;, who gave his name to the Carmathian
branch of the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s. These Carmathians (<i>Qar&aacute;mi&#7789;a</i>,
sing. <i>Qirmi&#7789;&iacute;</i>) spread over Southern Persia and Yemen, and
in the tenth century they threatened Baghd&aacute;d, repeatedly
waylaid the pilgrim-caravans, sacked Mecca and bore away
the Black Stone as a trophy; in short, established a veritable
reign of terror. We must return, however, to the main
Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;lite faction headed by the descendants of &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b.
Maym&uacute;n. Their emissaries discovered a promising field of
work in North Africa among the credulous and fanatical
Berbers. When all was ripe, Sa&#8216;&iacute;d b. &#7716;usayn, the grandson of
&#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Maym&uacute;n, left Salamya in Syria, the centre
from which the wires had hitherto been pulled, and <span class="sidenote">The F&aacute;&#7789;imid

crossing over to Africa appeared as the long-expected
Mahd&iacute; under the name of &#8216;Ubaydu&#8217;ll&aacute;h. He
gave himself out to be a great-grandson of the
Im&aacute;m Mu&#7717;ammad b. Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l and therefore in the
direct line of descent from &#8216;Al&iacute; b. Ab&iacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib and
F&aacute;&#7789;ima the daughter of the Prophet. We need not stop to
discuss this highly questionable genealogy from which the
F&aacute;&#7789;imid dynasty derives its name. In 910 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> &#8216;Ubaydu&#8217;ll&aacute;h
entered Raqq&aacute;da in triumph and assumed the title of Commander
of the Faithful. Tunis, where the Aghlabites had
ruled since 800 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, was the cradle of F&aacute;&#7789;imid power, and
here they built their capital, Mahdiyya, near the ancient
Thapsus. Gradually advancing eastward, they conquered
Egypt and Syria as far as Damascus (969-970 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). At this
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_275" id="Page_275" href="#"><span><i>THE F&Aacute;&#7788;IMIDS AND THE SELJ&Uacute;QS</i></span>275</a></span>
time the seat of government was removed to the newly-founded
city of Cairo (<i>al-Q&aacute;hira</i>), which remained for two centuries
the metropolis of the F&aacute;&#7789;imid Empire.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>

<p>The Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite Anti-Caliphs maintained themselves in Egypt
until 1171 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when the famous Saladin (&#7778;al&aacute;&#7717;u &#8217;l-D&iacute;n b.

Ayy&uacute;b) took possession of that country and
restored the Sunnite faith. He soon added Syria
to his dominions, and "the fall of Jerusalem (in
1187) roused Europe to undertake the Third Crusade." The
Ayy&uacute;bids were strictly orthodox, as behoved the champions of
Islam against Christianity. They built and endowed many
theological colleges. The &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; pantheist, Shih&aacute;bu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
al-Suhraward&iacute;, was executed at Aleppo by order of Saladin's
son, Malik al-&#7826;&aacute;hir, in 1191 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p class="tb">The two centuries preceding the extinction of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
Caliphate by the Mongols witnessed the rise and decline of
<span class="sidenote">The Selj&uacute;qs
(1037-1300 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
the Selj&uacute;q Turks, who "once more re-united
Mu&#7717;ammadan Asia from the western frontier
of Afghanistan to the Mediterranean under one
sovereign." Selj&uacute;q b. Tuq&aacute;q was a Turcoman chief.
Entering Transoxania, he settled near Bukh&aacute;r&aacute; and went
over with his whole people to Islam. His descendants,
&#7788;ughril Beg and Chagar Beg, invaded Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, annexed
the western provinces of the Ghaznevid Empire, and finally
absorbed the remaining dominions of the Buwayhids.
Baghd&aacute;d was occupied by &#7788;ughril Beg in 1055 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> It
has been said that the Selj&uacute;qs contributed almost nothing to
culture, but this perhaps needs some qualification. Although

devoted their energies in the first place to military affairs, the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_276" id="Page_276" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>276</a></span>
latter at least was an accomplished and enlightened monarch.
"He exerted himself to spread the benefits of civilisation: he
dug numerous canals, walled a great number of cities, built
bridges, and constructed <i>rib&aacute;&#7789;s</i> in the desert places."<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> He
was deeply interested in astronomy, and scientific as well as
theological studies received his patronage. Any shortcomings
of Alp Arsl&aacute;n and Malik Sh&aacute;h in this respect were amply
repaired by their famous minister, &#7716;asan b. &#8216;Al&iacute;, the Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu
&#8217;l-Mulk or 'Constable of the Empire,' to give him the title
which he has made his own. Like so many great Viziers, he
was a Persian, and his achievements must not detain us here,
but it may be mentioned that he founded in Baghd&aacute;d and
Nays&aacute;b&uacute;r the two celebrated academies which were called in
his honour al-Ni&#7827;&aacute;miyya.</p>

<p class="tb">We have now taken a general, though perforce an extremely
curtailed and disconnected, view of the political conditions
<span class="sidenote"> Arabia
and Spain.</span>
which existed during the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period in most
parts of the Mu&#7717;ammadan Empire except Arabia
and Spain. The motherland of Islam had long
sunk to the level of a minor province: leaving the Holy
Cities out of consideration, one might compare its inglorious
destiny under the Caliphate to that of Macedonia in the
empire which Alexander bequeathed to his successors, the
Ptolemies and Seleucids. As regards the political history of
Spain a few words will conveniently be said in a subsequent
chapter, where the literature produced by Spanish Moslems
will demand our attention. In the meantime we shall pass on
to the characteristic literary developments of this period, which
correspond more or less closely to the historical outlines.</p>

<p class="tb">The first thing that strikes the student of medi&aelig;val Arabic
literature is the fact that a very large proportion of the leading
writers are non-Arabs, or at best semi-Arabs, men whose fathers
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_277" id="Page_277" href="#"><span><i>FOREIGNERS WHO WROTE IN ARABIC</i></span>277</a></span>
or mothers were of foreign, and especially Persian, race. They
wrote in Arabic, because down to about 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> that
language was the sole medium of literary expression in the
Mu&#7717;ammadan world, a monopoly which it retained in
scientific compositions until the Mongol Invasion of the
thirteenth century. I have already referred to the question
whether such men as Bashsh&aacute;r b. Burd, Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, Ibn
Qutayba, &#7788;abar&iacute;, Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;, and hundreds of others should be
included in a literary history of the Arabs, and have given
reasons, which I need not repeat in this place, for considering
their admission to be not only desirable but fully justified on
logical grounds.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> The absurdity of treating them as Persians&mdash;and
there is no alternative, if they are not to be reckoned as
Arabs&mdash;appears to me self-evident.</p>

<p>"It is strange," says Ibn Khald&uacute;n, "that most of the learned
among the Moslems who have excelled in the religious or
intellectual sciences are non-Arabs (<i>&#8216;Ajam</i>) with rare exceptions;
and even those savants who claimed Arabian descent
spoke a foreign language, grew up in foreign lands, and
studied under foreign masters, notwithstanding that the community
to which they belonged was Arabian and the author
of its religion an Arab." The historian proceeds to explain
the cause of this singular circumstance in an interesting
passage which may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The first Moslems were entirely ignorant of art and science, all
their attention being devoted to the ordinances of the Koran, which
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn Khald&uacute;n's
explanation of
the fact that
learning was
chiefly cultivated
by the Persian
Moslems.</span>
they "carried in their breasts," and to the practice
(<i>sunna</i>) of the Prophet. At that time the Arabs knew
nothing of the way by which learning is taught, of the
art of composing books, and of the means whereby
knowledge is enregistered. Those, however, who
could repeat the Koran and relate the Traditions of
Mu&#7717;ammad were called Readers (<i>qurr&aacute;</i>). This oral transmission
continued until the reign of H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d, when the need of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_278" id="Page_278" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>278</a></span>

securing the Traditions against corruption or of preventing their
total loss caused them to be set down in writing; and in order to
distinguish the genuine Traditions from the spurious, every <i>isn&aacute;d</i>
(chain of witnesses) was carefully scrutinised. Meanwhile the
purity of the Arabic tongue had gradually become impaired: hence
arose the science of grammar; and the rapid development of Law
and Divinity brought it about that other sciences, <i>e.g.</i>, logic and
dialectic, were professionally cultivated in the great cities of the
Mu&#7717;ammadan Empire. The inhabitants of these cities were chiefly
Persians, freedmen and tradesmen, who had been long accustomed
to the arts of civilisation. Accordingly the most eminent of the
early grammarians, traditionists, and scholastic theologians, as
well as of those learned in the principles of Law and in the interpretation
of the Koran, were Persians by race or education, and the
saying of the Prophet was verified&mdash;"<i>If Knowledge were attached to
the ends of the sky, some amongst the Persians would have reached it.</i>"
Amidst all this intellectual activity the Arabs, who had recently
emerged from a nomadic life, found the exercise of military and
administrative command too engrossing to give them leisure for
literary avocations which have always been disdained by a ruling
caste. They left such studies to the Persians and the mixed race
(<i>al-muwallad&uacute;n</i>), which sprang from intermarriage of the conquerors
with the conquered. They did not entirely look down
upon the men of learning but recognised their services&mdash;since after
all it was Islam and the sciences connected with Islam that profited
thereby.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></p></div>

<p>Even in the Umayyad period, as we have seen, the maxim
that Knowledge is Power was strikingly illustrated by the
immense social influence which Persian divines exerted in the
Mu&#7717;ammadan community.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> Nevertheless, true Arabs of the
old type regarded these <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> and their learning with
undisguised contempt. To the great majority of Arabs, who
prided themselves on their noble lineage and were content to
know nothing beyond the glorious traditions of heathendom
and the virtues practised by their sires, all literary culture
seemed petty and degrading. Their overbearing attitude

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_279" id="Page_279" href="#"><span><i>ARABS AND NON-ARABS</i></span>279</a></span>

towards the <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>, which is admirably depicted in the first
part of Goldziher's <i>Muhammedanische Studien</i>, met with a
vigorous response. Non-Arabs and Moslem pietists alike
appealed to the highest authority&mdash;the Koran; and since they
required a more definite and emphatic pronouncement than
was forthcoming from that source, they put in the mouth of
the Prophet sayings like these: "He that speaks Arabic is
thereby an Arab"; "whoever of the people of Persia accepts
Islam is (as much an Arab as) one of Quraysh." This
doctrine made no impression upon the Arabian aristocracy, but
with the downfall of the Umayyads the political and social
equality of the <i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i> became an accomplished fact. Not
that the Arabs were at all disposed to abate their pretensions.
They bitterly resented the favour which the foreigners enjoyed
and the influence which they exercised. The national indignation
finds a voice in many poems of the early &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
period, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"See how the asses which they used to ride</span><span class="i0">
They have unsaddled, and sleek mules bestride!</span><span class="i0">
No longer kitchen-herbs they buy and sell,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></span><span class="i0">

</div></div>

<p>The side of the non-Arabs in this literary quarrel was
vehemently espoused by a party who called themselves the
Shu&#8216;&uacute;bites (<i>al-Shu&#8216;&uacute;biyya</i>),<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> while their opponents gave them

the name of Levellers (<i>Ahlu &#8217;l-Taswiya</i>), because they contended
for the equality of all Moslems without regard to distinctions
of race. I must refer the reader who seeks information <span class="sidenote">The Shu&#8216;&uacute;bites.</span>
concerning the history of the movement to
Goldziher's masterly study,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> where the controversial methods
adopted by the Shu&#8216;&uacute;bites are set forth in ample detail. He
shows how the bolder spirits among them, not satisfied with
claiming an <i>equal</i> position, argued that the Arabs were absolutely
inferior to the Persians and other peoples. The question
was hotly debated, and many eminent writers took part in the
fray. On the Shu&#8216;&uacute;bite side Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda, B&iacute;r&uacute;n&iacute;, and
&#7716;amza of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n deserve mention. J&aacute;&#7717;i&#7827; and Ibn Durayd
were the most notable defenders of their own Arabian
nationality, but the 'pro-Arabs' also included several men
of Persian origin, such as Ibn Qutayba, Bal&aacute;dhur&iacute;, and
Zamakhshar&iacute;. The Shu&#8216;&uacute;bites directed their attacks principally
against the racial pride of the Arabs, who were fond of
boasting that they were the noblest of all mankind and spoke
the purest and richest language in the world. Consequently
the Persian genealogists and philologists lost no opportunity of
bringing to light scandalous and discreditable circumstances
connected with the history of the Arab tribes or of particular
families. Arabian poetry, especially the vituperative pieces
(<i>math&aacute;lib</i>), furnished abundant matter of this sort, which was
adduced by the Shu&#8216;&uacute;bites as convincing evidence that the
claims of the Arabs to superior nobility were absurd. At the
same time the national view as to the unique and incomparable
excellence of the Arabic language received some rude criticism.</p>

<p>So acute and irreconcilable were the racial differences
between Arabs and Persians that one is astonished to see how
thoroughly the latter became Arabicised in the course of a

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_281" id="Page_281" href="#"><span><i>THE SHU&#8216;&Uacute;BITES</i></span>281</a></span>

few generations. As clients affiliated to an Arab tribe, they
assumed Arabic names and sought to disguise their foreign extraction
by fair means or foul. Many provided <span class="sidenote"> Assimilation of
Arabs and
Persians.</span>
themselves with fictitious pedigrees, on the strength
of which they passed for Arabs. Such a pretence
could have deceived nobody if it had not been supported by a
complete assimilation in language, manners, and even to some
extent in character. On the neutral ground of Mu&#7717;ammadan
science animosities were laid aside, and men of both races
laboured enthusiastically for the common cause. When at
length, after a century of bloody strife and engrossing political
agitation, the great majority of Moslems found themselves
debarred from taking part in public affairs, it was only natural
that thousands of ardent and ambitious souls should throw
their pent-up energies into the pursuit of wealth or learning.
We are not concerned here with the marvellous development
of trade under the first &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphs, of which Von
Kremer has given a full and entertaining description in his
<i>Culturgeschichte des Orients</i>. It may be recalled, however, that
many commercial terms, <i>e.g.</i>, tariff, names of fabrics (muslin,
tabby, &amp;c.), occurring in English as well as in most European
languages are of Arabic origin and were brought to Europe
by merchants from Baghd&aacute;d, Mosul, Ba&#7779;ra, and other cities of
Western Asia. This material expansion was accompanied by
an outburst of intellectual activity such as the East <span class="sidenote">Enthusiasm for
learning in the
early &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
period.</span>
had never witnessed before. It seemed as if all
the world from the Caliph down to the humblest
citizen suddenly became students, or at least
patrons, of literature. In quest of knowledge men travelled
over three continents and returned home, like bees laden with
honey, to impart the precious stores which they had accumulated
to crowds of eager disciples, and to compile with
incredible industry those works of encyclop&aelig;dic range and
erudition from which modern Science, in the widest sense of
the word, has derived far more than is generally supposed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_282" id="Page_282" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>282</a></span>

The Revolution which made the fortune of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
House was a triumph for Islam and the party of religious
<span class="sidenote"> Development of
the Moslem
sciences.</span>
reform. While under the worldly Umayyads the
studies of Law and Tradition met with no public
encouragement and were only kept alive by the
pious zeal of oppressed theologians, the new dynasty drew its
strength from the Mu&#7717;ammadan ideas which it professed to
establish, and skilfully adapted its policy to satisfying the ever-increasing
claims of the Church. Accordingly the Moslem
sciences which arose at this time proceeded in the first instance
from the Koran and the &#7716;ad&iacute;th. The sacred books offered
many difficulties both to provincial Arabs and especially to
Persians and other Moslems of foreign extraction. For their
right understanding a knowledge of Arabic grammar and
philology was essential, and this involved the study of the
ancient Pre-islamic poems which supplied the most authentic
models of Arabian speech in its original purity. The study of
these poems entailed researches into genealogy and history,
which in the course of time became independent branches of
learning. Similarly the science of Tradition was systematically
developed in order to provide Moslems with practical
rules for the conduct of life in every conceivable particular,
and various schools of Law sprang into existence.</p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammadan writers usually distinguish the sciences which
are connected with the Koran and those which the Arabs
<span class="sidenote"> Their
classification.</span>
learned from foreign peoples. In the former
class they include the Traditional or Religious
Sciences (<i>al-&#8216;Ul&uacute;m al-Naqliyya awi &#8217;l-Shar&#8216;iyya</i>)
and the Linguistic Sciences (<i>&#8216;Ul&uacute;mu &#8217;l-Lis&aacute;ni &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;</i>); in
the latter the Intellectual or Philosophical Sciences (<i>al-&#8216;Ul&uacute;m
al-&#8216;Aqliyya awi &#8217;l-&#7716;ikmiyya</i>), which are sometimes called 'The
Sciences of the Foreigners' (<i>&#8216;Ul&uacute;mu &#8217;l-&#8216;Ajam</i>) or 'The Ancient
Sciences' (<i>al-&#8216;Ul&uacute;m al-Qad&iacute;ma</i>).</p>

<p>The religious phenomena of the Period will be discussed in
a separate chapter, and here I can only allude cursorily to their
<span class="sidenote">The early
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period
favourable to
free-thought.</span>
general character. We have seen that during the
whole Umayyad epoch, except in the brief reign of
&#8216;Umar b. &#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Az&iacute;z, the professors of religion
were out of sympathy with the court, and that
many of them withdrew from all participation in public affairs.
It was otherwise when the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids established themselves in
power. Theology now dwelt in the shadow of the throne
and directed the policy of the Government. Honours were
showered on eminent jurists and divines, who frequently held
official posts of high importance and stood in the most confidential
and intimate relations to the Caliph; a classical example
is the friendship of the Cadi Ab&uacute; Y&uacute;suf and H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d.
The century after the Revolution gave birth to the four great
schools of Muhammadan Law, which are still called by the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_284" id="Page_284" href="#"><span><i>THE CALIPHS OF BAGHD&Aacute;D</i></span>284</a></span>
names of their founders&mdash;M&aacute;lik b. Anas, Ab&uacute; &#7716;an&iacute;fa, Sh&aacute;fi&#8216;&iacute;,
and Ahmad b. &#7716;anbal. At this time the scientific and intellectual
movement had free play. The earlier Caliphs usually encouraged
speculation so long as it threatened no danger to the
existing <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. Under Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n and his successors the
Mu&#8216;tazilite Rationalism became the State religion, and Islam
seemed to have entered upon an era of enlightenment. Thus
the first &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period (750-847 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) with its new learning
and liberal theology may well be compared to the European
Renaissance; but in the words of a celebrated Persian poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">

"Life is a very splendid robe: its fault is brevity."</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Caliph Mutawakkil (847-861 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) signalised his
accession by declaring the Mu&#8216;tazilite doctrines to be heretical
<span class="sidenote"> The triumph of
orthodoxy.</span>
and by returning to the traditional faith. Stern
measures were taken against dissenters. Henceforth
there was little room in Islam for independent
thought. The populace regarded philosophy and natural
science as a species of infidelity. Authors of works on these
subjects ran a serious risk unless they disguised their true
opinions and brought the results of their investigations into
apparent conformity with the text of the Koran. About the
middle of the tenth century the reactionary spirit assumed a
dogmatic shape in the system of Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan al-Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, the
father of Mu&#7717;ammadan Scholasticism, which is essentially
opposed to intellectual freedom and has maintained its petrifying
influence almost unimpaired down to the present time.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>

<h5>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE IN THE &#8216;ABB&Aacute;SID PERIOD</h5>

<p>Pre-Islamic poetry was the natural expression of nomad life.
We might therefore have expected that the new conditions
<span class="sidenote"> The Pre-islamic
poets regarded
as classical.</span>
and ideas introduced by Islam would rapidly work a
corresponding revolution in the poetical literature
of the following century. Such, however, was
far from being the case. The Umayyad poets clung tenaciously
to the great models of the Heroic Age and even took
credit for their skilful imitation of the antique odes. The
early Mu&#7717;ammadan critics, who were philologists by profession,
held fast to the principle that Poetry in Pre-islamic times had
reached a perfection which no modern bard could hope to
emulate, and which only the lost ideals of chivalry could
inspire.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> To have been born after Islam was in itself a proof
of poetical inferiority.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> Linguistic considerations, of course,
entered largely into this prejudice. The old poems were
studied as repositories of the pure classical tongue and were
estimated mainly from a grammarian's standpoint.</p>

<p>These ideas gained wide acceptance in literary circles
and gradually biassed the popular taste to such an extent
that learned pedants could boast, like Khal&iacute;l b. Ahmad,
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_286" id="Page_286" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>286</a></span>
the inventor of Arabic prosody, that it lay in their
power to make or mar the reputation of a rising poet
as they deemed fit. Originality being condemned in
advance, those who desired the approval of this self-constituted
Academy were obliged to waste their time and talents
upon elaborate reproduction of the ancient masterpieces, and
to entertain courtiers and citizens with borrowed pictures of
Bedouin life in which neither they nor their audience took the
slightest interest. Some, it is true, recognised the absurdity of
the thing. Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s (&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 810 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) often
ridicules the custom, to which reference has <span class="sidenote"> Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s
as a critic.</span>
been made elsewhere, of apostrophising the
deserted encampment (<i>a&#7789;l&aacute;l</i> or <i>&#7789;ul&uacute;l</i>) in the opening lines
of an ode, and pours contempt on the fashionable glorification
of antiquity. In the passage translated below he gives
a description of the desert and its people which recalls some
of Dr. Johnson's sallies at the expense of Scotland and
Scotsmen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Let the south-wind moisten with rain the desolate scene</span><span class="i0">
And Time efface what once was so fresh and green!</span><span class="i0">

Where high-bred camels trot with unwearied pace;</span><span class="i0">
Where only mimosas and thistles flourish, and where,</span><span class="i0">

</div></div>

<p>Ibn Qutayba, who died towards the end of the ninth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, was the first critic of importance to declare that
ancients and moderns should be judged on their merits without
regard to their age. He writes as follows in the Introduction
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_287" id="Page_287" href="#"><span><i>ANCIENT AND MODERN POETS</i></span>287</a></span>
to his 'Book of Poetry and Poets' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Shi&#8216;r wa-&#8217;l-Shu&#8216;ar&aacute;</i>):&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In citing extracts from the works of the poets I have been
guided by my own choice and have refused to admire anything
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn Qutayba on
ancient and
modern poets.</span>
merely because others thought it admirable. I have
not regarded any ancient with veneration on account
of his antiquity nor any modern with contempt on
account of his being modern, but I have taken an impartial view
of both sides, giving every one his due and amply acknowledging
his merit. Some of our scholars, as I am aware, pronounce a feeble
poem to be good, because its author was an ancient, and include
it among their chosen pieces, while they call a sterling poem bad
though its only fault is that it was composed in their own time or
that they have seen its author. God, however, did not restrict
learning and poetry and rhetoric to a particular age nor appropriate
them to a particular class, but has always distributed them in
common amongst His servants, and has caused everything old to be
new in its own day and every classic work to be an upstart on its
first appearance."</p></div>

<p>The inevitable reaction in favour of the new poetry and of
contemporary literature in general was hastened by various
<span class="sidenote"> Revolt against
classicism.</span>
circumstances which combined to overthrow the
prevalent theory that Arabian heathendom and
the characteristic pagan virtues&mdash;honour, courage,
liberality, &amp;c.&mdash;were alone capable of producing poetical
genius. Among the chief currents of thought tending in
this direction, which are lucidly set forth in Goldziher's
essay, pp. 148 sqq., we may note (<i>a</i>) the pietistic and theological
spirit fostered by the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Government, and (<i>b</i>) the
influence of foreign, pre-eminently Persian, culture. As to
the former, it is manifest that devout Moslems would not be
at all disposed to admit the exclusive pretensions made on
behalf of the <i>J&aacute;hiliyya</i> or to agree with those who exalted
chivalry (<i>muruwwa</i>) above religion (<i>d&iacute;n</i>). Were not the
language and style of the Koran incomparably excellent?
Surely the Holy Book was a more proper subject for study
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_288" id="Page_288" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>288</a></span>
than heathen verses. But if Moslems began to call Pre-islamic
ideals in question, it was especially the Persian
ascendancy resulting from the triumph of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
House that shook the old arrogant belief of the Arabs in
the intellectual supremacy of their race. So far from glorying
in the traditions of paganism, many people thought it
grossly insulting to mention an &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliph in the same
breath with heroes of the past like &#7716;&aacute;tim of &#7788;ayyi&#8217; and
Harim b. Sin&aacute;n. The philosopher al-Kind&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;about
850 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) rebuked a poet for venturing on such odious
comparisons. "Who are these Arabian vagabonds" (<i>&#7779;a&#8216;&aacute;l&iacute;ku
&#8217;l-&#8216;Arab</i>), he asked, "and what worth have they?"<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

<p>While Ibn Qutayba was content to urge that the modern
poets should get a fair hearing, and should be judged not
<span class="sidenote"> Critics in favour
of the
modern school.</span>
chronologically or philologically, but <i>&aelig;sthetically</i>,
some of the greatest literary critics who
came after him do not conceal their opinion
that the new poetry is superior to the old. Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1038 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) asserts that in tenderness and elegance the
Pre-islamic bards are surpassed by their successors, and that
both alike have been eclipsed by his contemporaries. Ibn
Rash&iacute;q (&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 1070 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), whose <i>&#8216;Umda</i> on the Art of
Poetry is described by Ibn Khald&uacute;n as an epoch-making
work, thought that the superiority of the moderns would
be acknowledged if they discarded the obsolete conventions
of the Ode. European readers cannot but sympathise with
him when he bids the poets draw inspiration from nature and
truth instead of relating imaginary journeys on a camel which
they never owned, through deserts which they never saw, to a
patron residing in the same city as themselves. This seems
to us a very reasonable and necessary protest, but it must be
remembered that the Bedouin <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i> was not easily adaptable
to the conditions of urban life, and needed complete remoulding
rather than modification in detail.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_289" id="Page_289" href="#"><span><i>THE CLASSICS OUT OF FAVOUR</i></span>289</a></span></p>

<p>"In the fifth century," says Goldziher&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from about
1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&mdash;"the dogma of the unattainable perfection of
<span class="sidenote"> Popularity of the
modern poets.</span>
the heathen poets may be regarded as utterly
demolished." Henceforth popular taste ran
strongly in the other direction, as is shown by
the immense preponderance of modern pieces in the anthologies&mdash;a
favourite and characteristic branch of Arabic
literature&mdash;which were compiled during the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period
and afterwards, and by frequent complaints of the neglect
into which the ancient poetry had fallen. But although, for
Moslems generally, Imru&#8217;u &#8217;l-Qays and his fellows came to
be more or less what Chaucer is to the average Englishman,
the views first enunciated by Ibn Qutayba met with bitter
opposition from the learned class, many of whom clung
obstinately to the old philological principles of criticism,
and even declined to recognise the writings of Mutanabb&iacute;
and Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute; as poetry, on the ground that
those authors did not observe the classical 'types' (<i>as&aacute;l&iacute;b</i>).<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
The result of such pedantry may be seen at the present day
in thousands of <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;das</i>, abounding in archaisms and allusions
to forgotten far-off things of merely antiquarian interest,
but possessing no more claim to consideration here than the
Greek and Latin verses of British scholars in a literary history
of the Victorian Age.</p>

<p class="tb">Passing now to the characteristics of the new poetry which
followed the accession of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids, we have to bear in
<span class="sidenote"> Characteristics
of the
new poetry.</span>
mind that from first to last (with very few exceptions)
it flourished under the patronage of the
court. There was no organised book trade, no
wealthy publishers, so that poets were usually dependent for
their livelihood on the capricious bounty of the Caliphs and
his favourites whom they belauded. Huge sums were paid
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_290" id="Page_290" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>290</a></span>
for a successful panegyric, and the bards vied with each
other in flattery of the most extravagant description. Even
in writers of real genius this prostitution of their art gave rise
to a great deal of the false glitter and empty bombast which
are often erroneously attributed to Oriental poetry as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>
These qualities, however, are absolutely foreign to Arabian
poetry of the best period. The old Bedouins who praised a
man only for that which was in him, and drew their images
directly from nature, stand at the opposite pole to Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;'s
contemporaries. Under the Umayyads, as we have seen, little
change took place. It is not until after the enthronement of
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids, when Persians filled the chief offices at court,
and when a goodly number of poets and eminent men of
learning had Persian blood in their veins, that an unmistakably
new note makes itself heard. One might be
tempted to surmise that the high-flown, bombastic, and
ornate style of which Mutanabb&iacute; is the most illustrious
exponent, and which is so marked a feature in later
Mu&#7717;ammadan poetry, was first introduced by the Persians and
Perso-Arabs who gathered round the Caliph in Baghd&aacute;d and
celebrated the triumph of their own race in the person of a
noble Barmecide; but this would scarcely be true. The
style in question is not specially Persian; the earliest Arabic-writing
poets of &Iacute;r&aacute;nian descent, like Bashsh&aacute;r b. Burd and
Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, are (so far as I can see) without a trace of it.
What the Persians brought into Arabian poetry was not a
grandiose style, but a lively and graceful fancy, elegance of
diction, depth and tenderness of feeling, and a rich store
of ideas.</p>

<p>The process of transformation was aided by other causes
besides the influx of Persian and Hellenistic culture: for
example, by the growing importance of Islam in public life
and the diffusion of a strong religious spirit among the community
at large&mdash;a spirit which attained its most perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_291" id="Page_291" href="#"><span><i>THE NEW POETRY</i></span>291</a></span>
expression in the reflective and didactic poetry of Abu
&#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya. Every change of many-coloured life is depicted
in the brilliant pages of these modern poets, where the reader
may find, according to his mood, the maddest gaiety and the
shamefullest frivolity; strains of lofty meditation mingled
with a world-weary pessimism; delicate sentiment, unforced
pathos, and glowing rhetoric; but seldom the manly self-reliance,
the wild, invigorating freedom and inimitable
freshness of Bedouin song.</p>

<p class="tb">It is of course impossible to do justice even to the principal
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid poets within the limits of this chapter, but the following
<span class="sidenote">Five typical
poets of the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period.</span>
five may be taken as fairly representative:
Mu&#7789;&iacute;&#8216; b. Iy&aacute;s, Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya,
Mutanabb&iacute;, and Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute;. The
first three were in close touch with the court of Baghd&aacute;d,
while Mutanabb&iacute; and Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; flourished under the
&#7716;amd&aacute;nid dynasty which ruled in Aleppo.</p>

<p class="tb">Mu&#7789;&iacute;&#8216; b. Iy&aacute;s only deserves notice here as the earliest poet
of the New School. His father was a native of Palestine, but
<span class="sidenote">Mu&#7789;&iacute;&#8216; b. Iy&aacute;s.</span>
he himself was born and educated at K&uacute;fa. He
began his career under the Umayyads, and was
devoted to the Caliph Wal&iacute;d b. Yaz&iacute;d, who found in him a
fellow after his own heart, "accomplished, dissolute, an agreeable
companion and excellent wit, reckless in his effrontery
and suspected in his religion."<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> When the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids came
into power Mu&#7789;&iacute;&#8216; attached himself to the Caliph Man&#7779;&uacute;r.
Many stories are told of the debauched life which he led
in the company of <i>zind&iacute;qs</i>, or freethinkers, a class of men
whose opinions we shall sketch in another chapter. His
songs of love and wine are distinguished by their lightness
and elegance. The best known is that in which he laments
his separation from the daughter of a <i>Dihq&aacute;n</i> (Persian landed
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_292" id="Page_292" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>292</a></span>
proprietor), and invokes the two palm-trees of &#7716;ulw&aacute;n, a
town situated on the borders of the Jib&aacute;l province between
Hamadh&aacute;n and Baghd&aacute;d. From this poem arose the
proverb, "Faster friends than the two palm-trees of

<p>By Europeans who know him only through the <i>Thousand

<span class="sidenote">Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s
(&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 810 a.d.).</span>
and court jester of "the good Haroun
Alraschid," and as the hero of countless droll
adventures and facetious anecdotes&mdash;an Oriental
Howleglass or Joe Miller. It is often forgotten that he was
a great poet who, in the opinion of those most competent to
judge, takes rank above all his contemporaries and successors,
including even Mutanabb&iacute;, and is not surpassed in poetical
genius by any ancient bard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_293" id="Page_293" href="#"><span><i>ABU NUW&Aacute;S</i></span>293</a></span></p>

<p>&#7716;asan b. H&aacute;ni&#8217; gained the familiar title of Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s
(Father of the lock of hair) from two locks which hung
down on his shoulders. He was born of humble parents,
about the middle of the eighth century, in A&#7717;w&aacute;z, the
capital of Kh&uacute;zist&aacute;n. That he was not a pure Arab the
name of his mother, Jallab&aacute;n, clearly indicates, while the following
verse affords sufficient proof that he was not ashamed
of his Persian blood:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>He received his education at Ba&#7779;ra, of which city he calls
himself a native,<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> and at K&uacute;fa, where he studied poetry and
philology under the learned Khalaf al-A&#7717;mar. After passing
a 'Wanderjahr' among the Arabs of the desert, as was the
custom of scholars at that time, he made his way to Baghd&aacute;d
and soon eclipsed every competitor at the court of H&aacute;r&uacute;n the
Orthodox. A man of the most abandoned character, which
he took no pains to conceal, Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, by his flagrant
immorality, drunkenness, and blasphemy, excited the Caliph's
anger to such a pitch that he often threatened the culprit with
death, and actually imprisoned him on several occasions; but
these fits of severity were brief. The poet survived both
H&aacute;r&uacute;n and his son, Am&iacute;n, who succeeded him in the
Caliphate. Age brought repentance&mdash;"the Devil was sick,
the Devil a monk would be." He addressed the following
lines from prison to Fa&#7693;l b. al-Rab&iacute;&#8216;, whom H&aacute;r&uacute;n appointed

<p>The D&iacute;w&aacute;n of Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s contains poems in many different
styles&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, panegyric (<i>mad&iacute;&#7717;</i>), satire (<i>hij&aacute;</i>), songs of
the chase (<i>&#7789;ardiyy&aacute;t</i>), elegies (<i>mar&aacute;th&iacute;</i>), and religious poems
(<i>zuhdiyy&aacute;t</i>); but love and wine were the two motives by

<p>Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s practised what he preached, and hypocrisy at
any rate cannot be laid to his charge. The moral and
religious sentiments which appear in some of his poems are
not mere cant, but should rather be regarded as the utterance
of sincere though transient emotion. Usually he felt and
avowed that pleasure was the supreme business of his life,
and that religious scruples could not be permitted to stand
in the way. He even urges others not to shrink from any
excess, inasmuch as the Divine mercy is greater than all the
sins of which a man is capable:&mdash;</p>

<p>We must now bid farewell to Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s and the
licentious poets (<i>al-shu&#8216;ar&aacute; al-mujj&aacute;n</i>) who reflect so admirably
the ideas and manners prevailing in court circles and
in the upper classes of society which were chiefly influenced
by the court. The scenes of luxurious dissipation and refined
debauchery which they describe show us, indeed, that Persian
culture was not an unalloyed blessing to the Arabs any more

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_296" id="Page_296" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>296</a></span>

than were the arts of Greece to the Romans; but this is only
the darker side of the picture. The works of a contemporary
poet furnish evidence of the indignation which the
libertinism fashionable in high places called forth among
the mass of Moslems who had not lost faith in morality and
religion.</p>

<p class="tb">Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya, unlike his great rival, came of Arab stock.
He was bred in K&uacute;fa, and gained his livelihood as a young

man by selling earthenware. His poetical talent,
however, promised so well that he set out to
present himself before the Caliph Mahd&iacute;, who
richly rewarded him; and H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d afterwards bestowed
on him a yearly pension of 50,000 dirhems (about
&pound;2,000), in addition to numerous extraordinary gifts. At
Baghd&aacute;d he fell in love with &#8216;Utba, a slave-girl belonging to
Mahd&iacute;, but she did not return his passion or take any notice of
the poems in which he celebrated her charms and bewailed the
sufferings that she made him endure. Despair of winning her
affection caused him, it is said, to assume the woollen garb of
Mu&#7717;ammadan ascetics,<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> and henceforth, instead of writing vain
and amatorious verses, he devoted his powers exclusively to
those joyless meditations on mortality which have struck a deep
chord in the hearts of his countrymen. Like Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;
al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute; and others who neglected the positive precepts of
Islam in favour of a moral philosophy based on experience and
reflection, Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya was accused of being a freethinker
(<i>zind&iacute;q</i>).<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> It was alleged that in his poems he often spoke of

death but never of the Resurrection and the Judgment&mdash;a
calumny which is refuted by many passages in his D&iacute;w&aacute;n.
According to the literary historian al-&#7778;&uacute;l&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;946 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), Abu
&#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya believed in One God who formed the universe out of
two opposite elements which He created from nothing; and
held, further, that everything would be reduced to these same
elements before the final destruction of all phenomena. Knowledge,
he thought, was acquired naturally (<i>i.e.</i>, without Divine
Revelation) by means of reflection, deduction, and research.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>
He believed in the threatened retribution (<i>al-wa&#8216;&iacute;d</i>) and in the
command to abstain from commerce with the world (<i>ta&#7717;r&iacute;mu
&#8217;l-mak&aacute;sib</i>).<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> He professed the opinions of the Butrites,<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> a
subdivision of the Zaydites, as that sect of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a was named
which followed Zayd b. Al&iacute; b. &#7716;usayn b. &#8216;Al&iacute; b. Ab&iacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib.
He spoke evil of none, and did not approve of revolt against the
Government. He held the doctrine of predestination (<i>jabr</i>).<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></p>

<p>Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya may have secretly cherished the Manich&aelig;an
views ascribed to him in this passage, but his poems contain
little or nothing that could offend the most orthodox Moslem.
The following verse, in which Goldziher finds an allusion to
Buddha,<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> is capable of a different interpretation. It rather

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_298" id="Page_298" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>298</a></span>

seems to me to exalt the man of ascetic life, without particular
reference to any individual, above all others:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>But while the poet avoids positive heresy, it is none the less
true that much of his D&iacute;w&aacute;n is not strictly religious in the
Mu&#7717;ammadan sense and may fairly be called 'philosophical.'
This was enough to convict him of infidelity and atheism in
the eyes of devout theologians who looked askance on moral
teaching, however pure, that was not cast in the dogmatic
mould. The pretended cause of his imprisonment by H&aacute;r&uacute;n
al-Rash&iacute;d&mdash;namely, that he refused to make any more love-songs&mdash;is
probably, as Goldziher has suggested, a popular version
of the fact that he persisted in writing religious poems which
were supposed to have a dangerous bias in the direction of
free-thought.</p>

<p>His poetry breathes a spirit of profound melancholy and hopeless
pessimism. Death and what comes after death, the frailty
and misery of man, the vanity of worldly pleasures and the duty
of renouncing them&mdash;these are the subjects on which he
dwells with monotonous reiteration, exhorting his readers to live
the ascetic life and fear God and lay up a store of good
works against the Day of Reckoning. The simplicity, ease,
and naturalness of his style are justly admired. Religious

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_299" id="Page_299" href="#"><span><i>ABU &#8217;L-&#8216;AT&Aacute;HIYA</i></span>299</a></span>

poetry, as he himself confesses, was not read at court or by
scholars who demanded rare and obscure expressions, but only
by pious folk, traditionists and divines, and especially by the
vulgar, "who like best what they can understand."<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a>
Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya wrote for 'the man in the street.' Discarding
conventional themes tricked out with threadbare artifices, he
appealed to common feelings and matters of universal experience.
He showed for the first and perhaps for the last
time in the history of classical Arabic literature that it was
possible to use perfectly plain and ordinary language without
ceasing to be a poet.</p>

<p>Although, as has been said, the bulk of Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya's
poetry is philosophical in character, there remains much
specifically Islamic doctrine, in particular as regards the
Resurrection and the Future Life. This combination may
be illustrated by the following ode, which is considered one
of the best that have been written on the subject of religion,
or, more accurately, of asceticism (<i>zuhd</i>):&mdash;</p>

<p>Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya found little favour with his contemporaries,

Kremer thinks that he had a truer genius for poetry than
Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, an opinion in which I am unable to concur.
Both, however, as he points out, are distinctive types of their
time. If Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s presents an appalling picture of a corrupt
and frivolous society devoted to pleasure, we learn from Abu
&#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya something of the religious feelings and beliefs which
pervaded the middle and lower classes, and which led them to
take a more earnest and elevated view of life.</p>

<p class="tb">With the rapid decline and disintegration of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
Empire which set in towards the middle of the ninth century,
numerous petty dynasties arose, and the hitherto unrivalled
splendour of Baghd&aacute;d was challenged by more than one provincial
court. These independent or semi-independent princes
were sometimes zealous patrons of learning&mdash;it is well known,
for example, that a national Persian literature first came into
being under the auspices of the S&aacute;m&aacute;nids in Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n and the
Buwayhids in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q&mdash;but as a rule the anxious task of maintaining,
or the ambition of extending, their power left them
small leisure to cultivate letters, even if they wished to do so.
None combined the arts of war and peace more brilliantly
than the &#7716;amd&aacute;nid Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla, who in 944 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> made
himself master of Aleppo, and founded an independent kingdom
in Northern Syria.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The &#7716;amd&aacute;nids," says Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;, "were kings and princes,
comely of countenance and eloquent of tongue, endowed with
<span class="sidenote">Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;'s
eulogy of
Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla.</span>
open-handedness and gravity of mind. Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla
is famed as the chief amongst them all and the centre-pearl
of their necklace. He was&mdash;may God be pleased
with him and grant his desires and make Paradise his
abode!&mdash;the brightest star of his age and the pillar of Islam: by
him the frontiers were guarded and the State well governed. His
attacks on the rebellious Arabs checked their fury and blunted
their teeth and tamed their stubbornness and secured his subjects
against their barbarity. His campaigns exacted vengeance from
the Emperor of the Greeks, decisively broke their hostile onset,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_304" id="Page_304" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATUE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>304</a></span>

and had an excellent effect on Islam. His court was the goal of
ambassadors, the dayspring of liberality, the horizon-point of hope,
the end of journeys, a place where savants assembled and poets
competed for the palm. It is said that after the Caliphs no prince
gathered around him so many masters of poetry and men illustrious
in literature as he did; and to a monarch's hall, as to a market,
people bring only what is in demand. He was an accomplished
scholar, a poet himself and a lover of fine poetry; keenly susceptible
to words of praise."<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></p></div>

<p>Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla's cousin, Ab&uacute; Fir&aacute;s al-&#7716;amd&aacute;n&iacute;, was a
gallant soldier and a poet of some mark, who if space permitted
would receive fuller notice here.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> He, however,
though superior to the common herd of court poets, is
overshadowed by one who with all his faults&mdash;and they are
not inconsiderable&mdash;made an extraordinary impression upon
his contemporaries, and by the commanding influence of his
reputation decided what should henceforth be the standard of
poetical taste in the Mu&#7717;ammadan world.</p>

<p>Abu &#8217;l-&#7788;ayyib Ahmad b. &#7716;usayn, known to fame as
al-Mutanabb&iacute;, was born and bred at K&uacute;fa, where his father
<span class="sidenote">Mutanabb&iacute;
(915-965 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
is said to have been a water-carrier. Following
the admirable custom by which young men of
promise were sent abroad to complete their
education, he studied at Damascus and visited other towns
in Syria, but also passed much of his time among the
Bedouins, to whom he owed the singular knowledge
and mastery of Arabic displayed in his poems. Here he
came forward as a prophet (from which circumstance he
was afterwards entitled al-Mutanabb&iacute;, <i>i.e.</i>, 'the pretender to
prophecy'), and induced a great multitude to believe in him;
but ere long he was captured by Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;, the governor of &#7716;ims
(Emessa), and thrown into prison. After his release he

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_305" id="Page_305" href="#"><span><i>MUTANABB&Iacute;</i></span>305</a></span>

wandered to and fro chanting the praises of all and sundry,
until fortune guided him to the court of Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla at
Aleppo. For nine years (948-957 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) he stood high in
the favour of that cultured prince, whose virtues he celebrated
in a series of splendid eulogies, and with whom he lived as an
intimate friend and comrade in arms. The liberality of Sayfu
&#8217;l-Dawla and the ingenious impudence of the poet are well
brought out by the following anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mutanabb&iacute; on one occasion handed to his patron the copy of an
ode which he had recently composed in his honour, and retired,
leaving Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla to peruse it at leisure. The prince began to
read, and came to these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

"<i>Pardon, bestow, endow, mount, raise, console, restore,</i></span><span class="i0">
<i>Add, laugh, rejoice, bring nigh, show favour, gladden, give!</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Far from being displeased by the poet's arrogance, Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla
was so charmed with his artful collocation of fourteen imperatives
in a single verse that he granted every request. Under <i>pardon</i> he
wrote 'we pardon thee'; under <i>bestow</i>, 'let him receive such and
such a sum of money'; under <i>endow</i>, 'we endow thee with an
estate,' which he named (it was beside the gate of Aleppo); under
<i>mount</i>, 'let such and such a horse be led to him'; under <i>raise</i>, 'we
do so'; under <i>console</i>, 'we do so, be at ease'; under <i>restore</i>, 'we
restore thee to thy former place in our esteem'; under <i>add</i>, 'let him
have such and such in addition'; under <i>bring nigh</i>, 'we admit thee
to our intimacy'; under <i>show favour</i>, 'we have done so'; under
<i>gladden</i>, 'we have made thee glad'<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a>; under <i>give</i>, 'this we have
already done.' Mutanabb&iacute;'s rivals envied his good fortune, and
one of them said to Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla&mdash;"Sire, you have done all that
he asked, but when he uttered the words <i>laugh</i>, <i>rejoice</i>, why did not
you answer, 'Ha, ha, ha'?" Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla laughed, and said, "You
too, shall have your wish," and ordered him a donation.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_306" id="Page_306" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>306</a></span>

Mutanabb&iacute; was sincerely attached to his generous master,
and this feeling inspired a purer and loftier strain than we
find in the fulsome panegyrics which he afterwards addressed
to the negro K&aacute;f&uacute;r. He seems to have been occasionally in
disgrace, but Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla could deny nothing to a poet
who paid him such magnificent compliments. Nor was he
deterred by any false modesty from praising himself: he was
fully conscious of his power and, like Arabian bards in
general, he bragged about it. Although the verbal legerdemain
which is so conspicuous in his poetry cannot be
reproduced in another language, the lines translated below
may be taken as a favourable and sufficiently characteristic
specimen of his style.</p>

<p>Finally an estrangement arose between Mutanabb&iacute; and
Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla, in consequence of which he fled to Egypt
and attached himself to the Ikhsh&iacute;dite K&aacute;f&uacute;r. Disappointed
in his new patron, a negro who had formerly been a slave, the
poet set off for Baghd&aacute;d, and afterwards visited the court of
the Buwayhid &#8216;A&#7693;udu &#8217;l-Dawla at Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z. While travelling
through Babylonia he was attacked and slain by brigands in
965 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>The popularity of Mutanabb&iacute; is shown by the numerous
commentaries<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> and critical treatises on his <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i>. By his
countrymen he is generally regarded as one of the greatest of
Arabian poets, while not a few would maintain that he ranks

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_308" id="Page_308" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>308</a></span>

absolutely first. Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute;, himself an illustrious
poet and man of letters, confessed that he had sometimes
wished to alter a word here and there in Mutanabb&iacute;'s verses,
but had never been able to think of any improvement. "As
to his poetry," says Ibn Khallik&aacute;n, "it is perfection."
European scholars, with the exception of Von Hammer,<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a>
have been far from sharing this enthusiasm, as may be seen by
referring to what has been said on the subject by Reiske,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> De
Sacy,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Bohlen,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> Brockelmann,<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> and others. No doubt, according
to our canons of taste, Mutanabb&iacute; stands immeasurably
below the famous Pre-islamic bards, and in a later age must
yield the palm to Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s and Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya. Lovers
of poetry, as the term is understood in Europe, cannot derive
much &aelig;sthetic pleasure from his writings, but, on the contrary,
will be disgusted by the beauties hardly less than by the faults
which Arabian critics attribute to him. Admitting, however,
that only a born Oriental is able to appreciate Mutanabb&iacute; at
his full worth, let us try to realise the Oriental point of view
and put aside, as far as possible, our preconceptions of what
constitutes good poetry and good taste. Fortunately we
possess abundant materials for such an attempt in the invaluable
work of Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;, which has been already mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a>
Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; (961-1038 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) was nearly contemporary with
Mutanabb&iacute;. He began to write his <i>Yat&iacute;ma</i> about thirty
years after the poet's death, and while he bears witness to

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_309" id="Page_309" href="#"><span><i>MUTANABB&Iacute;</i></span>309</a></span>

the unrivalled popularity of the <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> amongst all classes
of society, he observes that it was sharply criticised as well as
rapturously admired. Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; himself claims to hold the
balance even. "Now," he says, "I will mention the faults
and blemishes which critics have found in the poetry of
Mutanabb&iacute;; for is there any one whose qualities give entire
satisfaction?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i05">
'Tis the height of merit in a man that his faults can be numbered.</span>

<p>Then I will proceed to speak of his beauties and to set forth

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
The radiant stars with beauty strike our eyes</span><span class="i0">
Because midst gloom opaque we see them rise."</span>
</div></div>

<p>It was deemed of capital importance that the opening
couplet (<i>ma&#7789;la&#8216;</i>) of a poem should be perfect in form and
meaning, and that it should not contain anything likely
to offend. Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; brings forward many instances in which
Mutanabb&iacute; has violated this rule by using words of bad omen,
such as 'sickness' or 'death,' or technical terms of music
and arithmetic which only perplex and irritate the hearer
instead of winning his sympathy at the outset. He complains
also that Mutanabb&iacute;'s finest thoughts and images are too often
followed by low and trivial ones: "he strings pearls and
bricks together" (<i>jama&#8216;a bayna &#8217;l-durrati wa-&#8217;l-&aacute;jurrati</i>).
"While he moulds the most splendid ornament, and threads
the loveliest necklace, and weaves the most exquisite stuff of
mingled hues, and paces superbly in a garden of roses,
suddenly he will throw in a verse or two verses disfigured
by far-fetched metaphors, or by obscure language and confused
thought, or by extravagant affectation and excessive

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_310" id="Page_310" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>310</a></span>

profundity, or by unbounded and absurd exaggeration, or
by vulgar and commonplace diction, or by pedantry and
grotesqueness resulting from the use of unfamiliar words."
We need not follow Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; in his illustration of these
and other weaknesses with which he justly reproaches
Mutanabb&iacute;, since we shall be able to form a better idea
of the prevailing taste from those points which he singles
out for special praise.</p>

<p>In the first place he calls attention to the poet's skill in
handling the customary erotic prelude (<i>nas&iacute;b</i>), and particularly
to his brilliant descriptions of Bedouin women, which were
celebrated all over the East. As an example of this kind he
quotes the following piece, which "is chanted in the salons on
account of the extreme beauty of its diction, the choiceness of
its sentiment, and the perfection of its art":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Shame hitherto was wont my tears to stay,</span><span class="i0">
But now by shame they will no more be stayed,</span><span class="i0">
So that each bone seems through its skin to sob,</span><span class="i0">
And every vein to swell the sad cascade.</span><span class="i0">
She uncovered: pallor veiled her at farewell:</span><span class="i0">
No veil 'twas, yet her cheeks it cast in shade.</span><span class="i0">
So seemed they, while tears trickled over them,</span><span class="i0">
Gold with a double row of pearls inlaid.</span><span class="i0">
She loosed three sable tresses of her hair,</span><span class="i0">
And thus of night four nights at once she made;</span><span class="i0">
But when she lifted to the moon in heaven</span><span class="i0">
Her face, two moons together I surveyed."<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The critic then enumerates various beautiful and original
features of Mutanabb&iacute;'s style, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>1. His consecutive arrangement of similes in brief symmetrical
clauses, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"She shone forth like a moon, and swayed like a moringa-bough,</span><span class="i0">
And shed fragrance like ambergris, and gazed like a gazelle."</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_311" id="Page_311" href="#"><span><i>MUTANABB&Iacute;</i></span>311</a></span>

2. The novelty of his comparisons and images, as when he
indicates the rapidity with which he returned to his patron and
the shortness of his absence in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"I was merely an arrow in the air,</span><span class="i0">
Which falls back, finding no refuge there."</span>
</div></div>

<p>3. The <i>laus duplex</i> or 'two-sided panegyric' (<i>al-mad&#7717;
al-muwajjah</i>), which may be compared to a garment having
two surfaces of different colours but of equal beauty, as in
the following verse addressed to Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Were all the lives thou hast ta'en possessed by thee,</span><span class="i0">
Immortal thou and blest the world would be!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Here Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla is doubly eulogised by the mention of
his triumphs over his enemies as well as of the joy which all
his friends felt in the continuance of his life and fortune.</p>

<p>4. His manner of extolling his royal patron as though he
were speaking to a friend and comrade, whereby he raises
himself from the position of an ordinary encomiast to the same
level with kings.</p>

<p>5. His division of ideas into parallel sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"We were in gladness, the Greeks in fear,</span><span class="i0">
The land in bustle, the sea in confusion."</span>
</div></div>

<p>From this summary of Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;'s criticism the reader will
easily perceive that the chief merits of poetry were then considered
to lie in elegant expression, subtle combination of
words, fanciful imagery, witty conceits, and a striking use of
rhetorical figures. Such, indeed, are the views which prevail
to this day throughout the whole Mu&#7717;ammadan world, and it
is unreasonable to denounce them as false simply because they
do not square with ours. Who shall decide when nations
disagree? If Englishmen rightly claim to be the best judges
of Shakespeare, and Italians of Dante, the almost unanimous
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_312" id="Page_312" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>312</a></span>
verdict of Mutanabb&iacute;'s countrymen is surely not less authoritative&mdash;a
verdict which places him at the head of all the poets
born or made in Islam. And although the peculiar excellences
indicated by Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; do not appeal to us, there are few poets
that leave so distinct an impression of greatness. One might
call Mutanabb&iacute; the Victor Hugo of the East, for he has the
grand style whether he soars to sublimity or sinks to fustian.
In the masculine vigour of his verse, in the sweep and
splendour of his rhetoric, in the luxuriance and reckless
audacity of his imagination we recognise qualities which
inspired the oft-quoted lines of the elegist:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Him did his mighty soul supply</span><span class="i0">
With regal pomp and majesty.</span><span class="i0">

But in the <i>ideas</i>, all must own,</span><span class="i0">
His miracles were clearly shown."<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>One feature of Mutanabb&iacute;'s poetry that is praised by
Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; should not be left unnoticed, namely, his fondness
for sententious moralising on topics connected with human
life; wherefore Reiske has compared him to Euripides. He
is allowed to be a master of that proverbial philosophy in
which Orientals delight and which is characteristic of the
modern school beginning with Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya, though some
of the ancients had already cultivated it with success (cf.
the verses of Zuhayr, p. 118 <i>supra</i>). The following examples
are among those cited by Bohlen (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 86 sqq.):&mdash;</p>

<p>The sceptical and pessimistic tendencies of an age of social
decay and political anarchy are unmistakably revealed in the
<span class="sidenote">Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;
al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute; (973-1057
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
writings of the poet, philosopher, and man of
letters, Abu &#8216;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute;, who was born
in 973 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> at Ma&#8216;arratu &#8217;l-Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n, a Syrian
town situated about twenty miles south of Aleppo on the
caravan road to Damascus. While yet a child he had an
attack of small-pox, resulting in partial and eventually in
complete blindness, but this calamity, fatal as it might seem
to literary ambition, was repaired if not entirely made good
by his stupendous powers of memory. After being educated
at home under the eye of his father, a man of some culture
and a meritorious poet, he proceeded to Aleppo, which was
still a flourishing centre of the humanities, though it could no
longer boast such a brilliant array of poets and scholars as
were attracted thither in the palmy days of Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla.
Probably Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; did not enter upon the career of a
professional encomiast, to which he seems at first to have
inclined: he declares in the preface to his <i>Saq&#7789;u &#8217;l-Zand</i> that
he never eulogised any one with the hope of gaining a reward,
but only for the sake of practising his skill. On the termination
of his 'Wanderjahre' he returned in 993 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> to
Ma&#8216;arra, where he spent the next fifteen years of his life,
with no income beyond a small pension of thirty d&iacute;n&aacute;rs (which
he shared with a servant), lecturing on Arabic poetry, antiquities,
and philology, the subjects to which his youthful studies
had been chiefly devoted. During this period his reputation
was steadily increasing, and at last, to adapt what Boswell
wrote of Dr. Johnson on a similar occasion, "he thought of
trying his fortune in Baghd&aacute;d, the great field of genius and
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_314" id="Page_314" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>314</a></span>
exertion, where talents of every kind had the fullest scope
and the highest encouragement." Professor Margoliouth in
the Introduction to his edition of Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;'s <span class="sidenote"> His visit to
Baghd&aacute;d.</span>
correspondence supplies many interesting particulars
of the literary society at Baghd&aacute;d in which the
poet moved. "As in ancient Rome, so in the great Mu&#7717;ammadan
cities public recitation was the mode whereby men of
letters made their talents known to their contemporaries.
From very early times it had been customary to employ the
mosques for this purpose; and in Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;'s time poems
were recited in the mosque of al-Man&#7779;&uacute;r in Baghd&aacute;d. Better
accommodation was, however, provided by the M&aelig;cenates
who took a pride in collecting savants and <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> in their
houses."<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> Such a M&aelig;cenas was the Shar&iacute;f al-Ra&#7693;&iacute;, himself
a celebrated poet, who founded the Academy called by his
name in imitation, probably, of that founded some years
before by Ab&uacute; Nasr S&aacute;b&uacute;r b. Ardash&iacute;r, Vizier to the Buwayhid
prince, Bah&aacute;&#8217;u &#8217;l-Dawla. Here Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; met a number of
distinguished writers and scholars who welcomed him as one
of themselves. The capital of Islam, thronged with travellers
and merchants from all parts of the East, harbouring followers
of every creed and sect&mdash;Christians and Jews, Buddhists and
Zoroastrians, &#7778;&aacute;bians and &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, Materialists and Rationalists&mdash;must
have seemed to the provincial almost like a new world.
It is certain that Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;, a curious observer who set no
bounds to his thirst for knowledge, would make the best use
of such an opportunity. The religious and philosophical ideas
with which he was now first thrown into contact gradually
took root and ripened. His stay in Baghd&aacute;d, though it lasted
only a year and a half (1009-1010 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), decided the whole
bent of his mind for the future.</p>

<p>Whether his return to Ma&#8216;arra was hastened, as he says, by
want of means and the illness of his mother, whom he
tenderly loved, or by an indignity which he suffered at the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_315" id="Page_315" href="#"><span><i>ABU &#8217;L-&#8216;AL&Aacute; AL-MA&#8216;ARR&Iacute;</i></span>315</a></span>

hands of an influential patron,<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> immediately on his arrival he
shut himself in his house, adopted a vegetarian diet and other
ascetic practices, and passed the rest of his long life in comparative
seclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"Methinks, I am thrice imprisoned&mdash;ask not me</span><span class="i0">
Of news that need no telling&mdash;</span><span class="i0">

</div></div>

<p>We can only conjecture the motives which brought about this
sudden change of habits and disposition. No doubt his mother's
death affected him deeply, and he may have been disappointed
by his failure to obtain a permanent footing in the capital. It
is not surprising that the blind and lonely man, looking back
on his faded youth, should have felt weary of the world and
its ways, and found in melancholy contemplation of earthly
vanities ever fresh matter for the application and development
of these philosophical ideas which, as we have seen, were
probably suggested to him by his recent experiences. While
in the collection of early poems, entitled <i>Saq&#7789;u &#8217;l-Zand</i> or 'The
Spark of the Fire-stick' and mainly composed before his visit
to Baghd&aacute;d, he still treads the customary path of his predecessors,<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a>
his poems written after that time and generally
known as the <i>Luz&uacute;miyy&aacute;t</i><a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> arrest attention by their boldness
and originality as well as by the sombre and earnest tone which
pervades them. This, indeed, is not the view of most Oriental
critics, who dislike the poet's irreverence and fail to appreciate
the fact that he stood considerably in advance of his age; but
in Europe he has received full justice and perhaps higher
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_316" id="Page_316" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>316</a></span>
praise than he deserves. Reiske describes him as 'Arabice
callentissimum, vasti, subtilis, sublimis et audacis ingenii';<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a>
Von Hammer, who ranks him as a poet with Ab&uacute; Tamm&aacute;m,
Bu&#7717;tur&iacute;, and Mutanabb&iacute;, also mentions him honourably as a
philosopher;<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> and finally Von Kremer, who made an exhaustive
study of the <i>Luz&uacute;miyy&aacute;t</i> and examined their contents in a masterly
essay,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> discovered in Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;, one of the greatest moralists
of all time whose profound genius anticipated much that is
commonly attributed to the so-called modern spirit of enlightenment.
Here Von Kremer's enthusiasm may have
carried him too far; for the poet, as Professor Margoliouth
says, was unconscious of the value of his suggestions, unable
to follow them out, and unable to adhere to them consistently.
Although he builded better than he knew, the constructive
side of his philosophy was overshadowed by the negative and
destructive side, so that his pure and lofty morality leaves but a
faint impression which soon dies away in louder, continually
recurring voices of doubt and despair.</p>

<p>Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; is a firm monotheist, but his belief in God
amounted, as it would seem, to little beyond a conviction that
all things are governed by inexorable Fate, whose mysteries
none may fathom and from whose omnipotence there is no
escape. He denies the Resurrection of the dead, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are many passages to the same effect, showing that
Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; regarded procreation as a sin and universal annihilation
as the best hope for humanity. He acted in accordance
with his opinions, for he never married, and he is said to
have desired that the following verse should be inscribed on
his grave:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hating the present life and weary of its burdens, yet seeing
no happier prospect than that of return to non-existence, Abu
&#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; can scarcely have disguised from himself what he might
shrink openly to avow&mdash;that he was at heart, not indeed an
atheist, but wholly incredulous of any Divine revelation.
Religion, as he conceives it, is a product of the human mind,
in which men believe through force of habit and education,
never stopping to consider whether it is true.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sometimes you may find a man skilful in his trade, perfect in
sagacity and in the use of arguments, but when he comes to
religion he is found obstinate, so does he follow the old groove.

To the growing child that which falls from his elders' lips is a
lesson that abides with him all his life. Monks in their cloisters and
devotees in the mosques accept their creed just as a story is handed
down from him who tells it, without distinguishing between a true
interpreter and a false. If one of these had found his kin among
the Magians, he would have declared himself a Magian, or among
the &#7778;&aacute;bians, he would have become nearly or quite like <i>them</i>."<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></p></div>

<p>Religion, then, is "a fable invented by the ancients,"
worthless except to those unscrupulous persons who prey upon

<p>Not only does the poet emphatically reject the proud claim
of Islam to possess a monopoly of truth, but he attacks most
of its dogmas in detail. As to the Koran, Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; could
not altogether refrain from doubting if it was really the Word
of God, but he thought so well of the style that he accepted
the challenge flung down by Mu&#7717;ammad and produced a rival
work (<i>al-Fu&#7779;&uacute;l wa-&#8217;l-Gh&aacute;y&aacute;t</i>), which appears to have been a
somewhat frivolous parody of the sacred volume, though in the
author's judgment its inferiority was simply due to the fact
that it was not yet polished by the tongues of four centuries of
readers. Another work which must have sorely offended
orthodox Mu&#7717;ammadans is the <i>Ris&aacute;latu &#8217;l-Ghufr&aacute;n</i> (Epistle of
Forgiveness).<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Here the Paradise of the Faithful becomes

a glorified salon tenanted by various heathen poets who have
been forgiven&mdash;hence the title&mdash;and received among the Blest.
This idea is carried out with much ingenuity and in a spirit
of audacious burlesque that reminds us of Lucian. The poets
are presented in a series of imaginary conversations with a
certain Shaykh &#8216;Al&iacute; b. Man&#7779;&uacute;r, to whom the work is addressed,
reciting and explaining their verses, quarrelling with one
another, and generally behaving as literary Bohemians. The
second part contains a number of anecdotes relating to the
<i>zind&iacute;qs</i> or freethinkers of Islam interspersed with quotations
from their poetry and reflections on the nature of their belief,
which Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; condemns while expressing a pious hope
that they are not so black as they paint themselves. At this
time it may have suited him&mdash;he was over sixty&mdash;to assume
the attitude of charitable orthodoxy. Like so many wise men
of the East, he practised dissimulation as a fine art&mdash;</p>

<p>In the <i>Luz&uacute;miyy&aacute;t</i>, however, he often unmasks. Thus he
describes as idolatrous relics the two Pillars of the Ka&#8216;ba and
the Black Stone, venerated by every Moslem, and calls the
Pilgrimage itself 'a heathen's journey' (<i>ri&#7717;latu j&aacute;hiliyy<sup>in</sup></i>).

<p>It is needless to give further instances of the poet's contempt
for the Mu&#7717;ammadan articles of faith. Considering that he
assailed persons as well as principles, and lashed with bitter
invective the powerful class of the <i>&#8216;Ulam&aacute;</i>, the clerical and
legal representatives of Islam, we may wonder that the accusation
of heresy brought against him was never pushed home
and had no serious consequences. The question was warmly
argued on both sides, and though Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; was pronounced
by the majority to be a freethinker and materialist, he did not
lack defenders who quoted chapter and verse to prove that he
was nothing of the kind. It must be remembered that his
works contain no philosophical system; that his opinions have
to be gathered from the ideas which he scatters incoherently,
and for the most part in guarded language, through a long
succession of rhymes; and that this task, already arduous
enough, is complicated by the not infrequent occurrence of
sentiments which are blamelessly orthodox and entirely contradictory
to the rest. A brilliant writer, familiar with
Eastern ways of thinking, has observed that in general the
conscience of an Asiatic is composed of the following ingredients:
(1) an almost bare religious designation; (2) a
more or less lively belief in certain doctrines of the creed
which he professes; (3) a resolute opposition to many of its
doctrines, even if they should be the most essential; (4) a
fund of ideas relating to completely alien theories, which
occupies more or less room; (5) a constant tendency to get
rid of these ideas and theories and to replace the old by new.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a>
Such phenomena will account for a great deal of logical inconsistency,
but we should beware of invoking them too confidently
in this case. Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; with his keen intellect and
unfanatical temperament was not the man to let himself be
mystified. Still lamer is the explanation offered by some
Mu&#7717;ammadan critics, that his thoughts were decided by the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_321" id="Page_321" href="#"><span><i>ABU &#8217;L-&#8216;AL&Aacute; AL-MA&#8216;ARR&Iacute;</i></span>321</a></span>

necessities of the difficult metre in which he wrote. It is
conceivable that he may sometimes have doubted his own
doubts and given Islam the benefit, but Von Kremer's conclusion
is probably near the truth, namely, that where the
poet speaks as a good Moslem, his phrases if they are not
purely conventional are introduced of set purpose to foil his
pious antagonists or to throw them off the scent. Although
he was not without religion in the larger sense of the word,
unprejudiced students of the later poems must recognise that
from the orthodox standpoint he was justly branded as an
infidel. The following translations will serve to illustrate the
negative side of his philosophy:&mdash;</p>

<p>Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; died in 1057 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, at the age of eighty-four.
About ten years before this time, the Persian poet and
traveller, N&aacute;&#7779;ir-i Khusraw, passed through Ma&#8216;arra on his
way to Egypt. He describes Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; as the chief
man in the town, very rich, revered by the inhabitants,
and surrounded by more than two hundred students who
came from all parts to attend his lectures on literature and

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_324" id="Page_324" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>324</a></span>

poetry.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> We may set this trustworthy notice against the
doleful account which Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; gives of himself in his
letters and other works. If not among the greatest Mu&#7717;ammadan
poets, he is undoubtedly one of the most original
and attractive. After Mutanabb&iacute;, even after Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya,
he must appear strangely modern to the European reader.
It is astonishing to reflect that a spirit so unconventional, so
free from dogmatic prejudice, so rational in spite of his
pessimism and deeply religious notwithstanding his attacks
on revealed religion, should have ended his life in a Syrian
country-town some years before the battle of Senlac. Although
he did not meddle with politics and held aloof from
every sect, he could truly say of himself, "I am the son of
my time" (<i>ghadawtu &#8217;bna waqt&iacute;</i>).<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> His poems leave no
aspect of the age untouched, and present a vivid picture
of degeneracy and corruption, in which tyrannous rulers,
venal judges, hypocritical and unscrupulous theologians,
swindling astrologers, roving swarms of dervishes and godless
Carmathians occupy a prominent place.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></p>

<p class="tb">Although the reader may think that too much space has
been already devoted to poetry, I will venture by way of
concluding the subject to mention very briefly a few well-known
names which cannot be altogether omitted from a
work of this kind.</p>

<p>Ab&uacute; Tamm&aacute;m (&#7716;ab&iacute;b b. Aws) and Bu&#7717;tur&iacute;, both of whom
<span class="sidenote"> Ab&uacute; Tamm&aacute;m
and Bu&#7717;tur&iacute;.</span>
flourished in the ninth century, were distinguished court poets
of the same type as Mutanabb&iacute;, but their reputation
rests more securely on the anthologies which
they compiled under the title of <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i> (see
p. 129 seq.).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_325" id="Page_325" href="#"><span><i>IBNU &#8217;L-MU&#8216;TAZZ AND IBNU &#8217;L-F&Aacute;RI&#7692;</i></span>325</a></span>

Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h, the son of the Caliph al-Mu&#8216;tazz,
was a versatile poet and man of letters, who showed his
<span class="sidenote">Ibnu &#8217;l-Mu&#8216;tazz
(861-908 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
originality by the works which he produced in
two novel styles of composition. It has often
been remarked that the Arabs have no great
epos like the Iliad or the Persian <i>Sh&aacute;hn&aacute;ma</i>, but only prose
narratives which, though sometimes epical in tone, are better
described as historical romances. Ibnu &#8217;l-Mu&#8216;tazz could not
supply the deficiency. He wrote, however, in praise of his
cousin, the Caliph Mu&#8216;ta&#7693;id, a metrical epic in miniature,
commencing with a graphic delineation of the wretched state
to which the Empire had been reduced by the rapacity and
tyranny of the Turkish mercenaries. He composed also,
besides an anthology of Bacchanalian pieces, the first important
work on Poetics (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Bad&iacute;&#8216;</i>). A sad destiny was
in store for this accomplished prince. On the death of the
Caliph Muktar&iacute; he was called to the throne, but a few hours
after his accession he was overpowered by the partisans of
Muqtadir, who strangled him as soon as they discovered his
hiding-place. Picturing the scene, one thinks almost inevitably
of Nero's dying words, <i>Qualis artifex pereo!</i></p>

<p class="tb">The mystical poetry of the Arabs is far inferior, as a whole,
to that of the Persians. Fervour and passion it has in the
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Umar Ibnu

(1181-1235 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
highest degree, but it lacks range and substance,
not to speak of imaginative and speculative
power. &#8216;Umar Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, though he is
undoubtedly the poet of Arabian mysticism, cannot sustain a
comparison with his great Persian contemporary, Jal&aacute;lu&#8217;l-D&iacute;n
R&uacute;m&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1273 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>); he surpasses him only in the intense
glow and exquisite beauty of his diction. It will be convenient
to reserve a further account of Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; for the
next chapter, where we shall discuss the development of
&#7778;&uacute;fiism during this period.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_326" id="Page_326" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>326</a></span>
to single poems&mdash;a by no means rare phenomenon in
the history of Arabic literature. One of these universally
celebrated odes is the <i>L&aacute;miyyatu &#8217;l-&#8216;Ajam</i> (the ode rhyming
in <i>l</i> of the non-Arabs) composed in the year 1111 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> by

hymn in praise of the Prophet. Its author was born in
<span class="sidenote">B&uacute;&#7779;&iacute;r&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i>
1296 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Egypt in 1212 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> We know scarcely anything concerning
his life, which, as he himself declares,
was passed in writing poetry and in paying court
to the great<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a>; but his biographers tell us that
he supported himself by copying manuscripts, and that he
was a disciple of the eminent &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s A&#7717;mad
al-Mars&iacute;. It is said that he composed the <i>Burda</i> while
suffering from a stroke which paralysed one half of his
body. After praying God to heal him, he began to recite
the poem. Presently he fell asleep and dreamed that he
saw the Prophet, who touched his palsied side and threw his
mantle (<i>burda</i>) over him.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> "Then," said al-B&uacute;&#7779;&iacute;r&iacute;, "I awoke
and found myself able to rise." However this may be, the
Mantle Ode is held in extraordinary veneration by Mu&#7717;ammadans.
Its verses are often learned by heart and inscribed
in golden letters on the walls of public buildings; and not
only is the whole poem regarded as a charm against evil,
but some peculiar magical power is supposed to reside in
each verse separately. Although its poetical merit is no more
than respectable, the <i>Burda</i> may be read with pleasure on
account of its smooth and elegant style, and with interest as
setting forth in brief compass the medi&aelig;val legend of the
Prophet&mdash;a legend full of prodigies and miracles in which
the historical figure of Mu&#7717;ammad is glorified almost beyond
recognition.</p>

<p class="tb">Rhymed prose (<i>saj&#8216;</i>) long retained the religious associations
which it possessed in Pre-islamic times and which were
consecrated, for all Moslems, by its use in the Koran.
About the middle of the ninth century it began to appear

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_328" id="Page_328" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>328</a></span>

in the public sermons (<i>khu&#7789;ab</i>, sing. <i>khu&#7789;ba</i>) of the Caliphs
and their viceroys, and it was still further developed by professional
<span class="sidenote"> Rhymed prose.</span>
preachers, like Ibn Nub&aacute;ta (&#8224;&nbsp;984 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
and by official secretaries, like Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m b. Hil&aacute;l
al-&#7778;&aacute;b&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;994 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Henceforth rhyme becomes a distinctive
and almost indispensable feature of rhetorical prose.</p>

<p>The credit of inventing, or at any rate of making popular, a
new and remarkable form of composition in this style belongs
<span class="sidenote">Bad&iacute;&#8216;u &#8217;l-Zam&aacute;n
al-Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1007 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
to al-Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1007 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), on whom posterity
conferred the title <i>Bad&iacute;&#8216;u &#8217;l-Zam&aacute;n</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
'the Wonder of the Age.' Born in Hamadh&aacute;n
(Ecbatana), he left his native town as a young man and
travelled through the greater part of Persia, living by his
wits and astonishing all whom he met by his talent for
improvisation. His <i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> may be called a romance or
literary Bohemianism. In the <i>maq&aacute;ma</i> we find some approach
to the dramatic style, which has never been cultivated
by the Semites.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; imagined as his hero a
witty, unscrupulous vagabond journeying from place to place
and supporting himself by the presents which his impromptu
displays of rhetoric, poetry, and learning seldom failed to
draw from an admiring audience. The second character is
the <i>r&aacute;w&iacute;</i> or narrator, "who should be continually meeting
with the other, should relate his adventures, and repeat his
excellent compositions."<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> The <i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> of Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;

became the model for this kind of writing, and the types
which he created survive unaltered in the more elaborate
work of his successors. Each <i>maq&aacute;ma</i> forms an independent
whole, so that the complete series may be regarded as a
novel consisting of detached episodes in the hero's life, a
medley of prose and verse in which the story is nothing,
the style everything.</p>

<p>Less original than Bad&iacute;&#8216;u &#8217;l-Zam&aacute;n, but far beyond him in
variety of learning and copiousness of language, Ab&uacute;

Mu&#7717;ammad al-Q&aacute;sim al-&#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; of Ba&#7779;ra produced
in his <i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> a masterpiece which for
eight centuries "has been esteemed as, next to
the Koran, the chief treasure of the Arabic tongue." In the
Preface to his work he says that the composition of <i>maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i>
was suggested to him by "one whose suggestion is a command
and whom it is a pleasure to obey." This was the distinguished
Persian statesman, An&uacute;shirw&aacute;n b. Kh&aacute;lid,<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> who
afterwards served as Vizier under the Caliph Mustarshid
Bill&aacute;h (1118-1135 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and Sult&aacute;n Mas&#8216;&uacute;d, the Selj&uacute;q
(1133-1152 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>); but at the time when he made &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute;'s
acquaintance he was living in retirement at Ba&#7779;ra and devoting
himself to literary studies. &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; begged to be excused
on the score that his abilities were unequal to the task, "for
the lame steed cannot run like the strong courser."<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> Finally,
however, he yielded to the request of An&uacute;shirw&aacute;n, and, to
quote his own words&mdash;</p>

<p>&#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; then proceeds to argue that his <i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> are not
mere frivolous stories such as strict Moslems are bound to
reprobate in accordance with a well-known passage of the
Koran referring to Na&#7693;r b. &#7716;&aacute;rith, who mortally offended
the Prophet by amusing the Quraysh with the old Persian
legends of Rustam and Isfandiy&aacute;r (Koran, xxxi, 5-6):
"<i>There is one that buyeth idle tales that he may seduce men
from the way of God, without knowledge, and make it a laughing-stock:
these shall suffer a shameful punishment. And when Our
signs are read to him, he turneth his back in disdain as though he
heard them not, as though there were in his ears a deafness:
give him joy of a grievous punishment!</i>" &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; insists that
the <i>Assemblies</i> have a moral purpose. The ignorant and
malicious, he says, will probably condemn his work, but
intelligent readers will perceive, if they lay prejudice aside,
that it is as useful and instructive as the fables of beasts, &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a>
to which no one has ever objected. That his fears of hostile
criticism were not altogether groundless is shown by the

following remarks of the author of the popular history
entitled <i>al-Fakhr&iacute;</i> (&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 1300 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). This writer, after
claiming that his own book is more useful than the <i>&#7716;am&aacute;sa</i>

memory; because the reader derives no benefit from
<i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> except familiarity with elegant composition
and knowledge of the rules of verse and prose. Undoubtedly
they contain maxims and ingenious devices and experiences;
but all this has a debasing effect on the mind, for it is
founded on begging and sponging and disgraceful scheming to
acquire a few paltry pence. Therefore, if they do good in one
direction, they do harm in another; and this point has been
noticed by some critics of the <i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> of &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; and Bad&iacute;&#8216;u

<p>Before pronouncing on the justice of this censure, we must
consider for a moment the character of Ab&uacute; Zayd, the hero
<span class="sidenote"> The character of
Ab&uacute; Zayd.</span>
of &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute;'s work, whose adventures are related by
a certain &#7716;&aacute;rith b. Hamm&aacute;m, under which name
the author is supposed to signify himself. According
to the general tradition, &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; was one day seated with a
number of savants in the mosque of the Ban&uacute; &#7716;ar&aacute;m at Ba&#7779;ra,
when an old man entered, footsore and travel-stained. On
being asked who he was and whence he came, he answered
that his name of honour was Ab&uacute; Zayd and that he came
from Sar&uacute;j.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> He described in eloquent and moving terms
how his native town had been plundered by the Greeks,
who made his daughter a captive and drove him forth to
exile and poverty. &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; was so struck with his wonderful
powers of improvisation that on the same evening he began to
compose the <i>Maq&aacute;ma of the Ban&uacute; &#7716;ar&aacute;m</i>,<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> where Ab&uacute; Zayd

is introduced in his invariable character: "a crafty old man,
full of genius and learning, unscrupulous of the artifices which
he uses to effect his purpose, reckless in spending in forbidden
indulgences the money he has obtained by his wit or deceit,
but with veins of true feeling in him, and ever yielding to
unfeigned emotion when he remembers his devastated home
and his captive child."<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> If an immoral tendency has been
attributed to the <i>Assemblies</i> of &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; it is because the author
does not conceal his admiration for this unprincipled and
thoroughly disreputable scamp. Ab&uacute; Zayd, indeed, is made
so fascinating that we can easily pardon his knaveries for the
sake of the pearls of wit and wisdom which he scatters in
splendid profusion&mdash;excellent discourses, edifying sermons,
and plaintive lamentations mingled with rollicking ditties
and ribald jests. Modern readers are not likely to agree
with the historian quoted above, but although they may
deem his criticism illiberal, they can hardly deny that it has
some justification.</p>

<p>&#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute;'s rhymed prose might be freely imitated in English,

city lying midway between Hamadh&aacute;n (Ecbatana) and

himself to the public burial ground, for the purpose of contemplation.
He finds a funeral in progress, and when it is
over an old man, with his face muffled in a cloak, takes his
stand on a hillock, and pours forth a discourse on the certainty
of death and judgment.... He then rises into poetry and
declaims a piece which is one of the noblest productions of

The reader may judge from these extracts whether the
<i>Assemblies</i> of &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; are so deficient in matter as some critics
have imagined. But, of course, the celebrity of the work is
mainly due to its consummate literary form&mdash;a point on
which the Arabs have always bestowed singular attention.
&#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; himself was a subtle grammarian, living in Ba&#7779;ra, the
home of philological science;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> and though he wrote to please
rather than to instruct, he seems to have resolved that his
work should illustrate every beauty and nicety of which the
Arabic language is capable. We Europeans can see as little
merit or taste in the verbal conceits&mdash;equivoques, paronomasias,
assonances, alliterations, &amp;c.&mdash;with which his pages are
thickly studded, as in <i>tours de force</i> of composition which may
be read either forwards or backwards, or which consist entirely
of pointed or of unpointed letters; but our impatience of such
things should not blind us to the fact that they are intimately
connected with the genius and traditions of the Arabic tongue,<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a>
and therefore stand on a very different footing from those
euphuistic extravagances which appear, for example, in
English literature of the Elizabethan age. By &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute;'s
countrymen the <i>Maq&aacute;m&aacute;t</i> are prized as an almost unique
monument of their language, antiquities, and culture. One
of the author's contemporaries, the famous Zamakhshar&iacute;, has
expressed the general verdict in pithy verse&mdash;</p>

<span class="sidenote"> The religious
literature of the
period.</span>
in the following chapter, while as to the science
of Apostolic Tradition (<i>&#7716;ad&iacute;th</i>) we must refer the
reader to what has been already said. All that
can be attempted here is to take a passing notice of the most
eminent writers and the most celebrated works of this epoch in
the field of religion.</p>

<p>The place of honour belongs to the Im&aacute;m M&aacute;lik b. Anas
of Med&iacute;na, whose <i>Muwa&#7789;&#7789;a&#8217;</i> is the first great <i>corpus</i> of
<span class="sidenote">M&aacute;lik b. Anas
(713-795 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Mu&#7717;ammadan Law. He was a partisan of the
&#8216;Alids, and was flogged by command of the
Caliph Man&#7779;&uacute;r in consequence of his declaration
that he did not consider the oath of allegiance to the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
dynasty to have any binding effect.</p>

<p>The two principal authorities for Apostolic Tradition are
Bukh&aacute;r&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;870 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and Muslim (&#8224;&nbsp;875 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), authors of the
collections entitled <i>&#7778;a&#7717;&iacute;&#7717;</i>. Compilations of a <span class="sidenote"> Bukh&aacute;r&iacute; and
Muslim.</span>
narrower range, embracing only those traditions
which bear on the <i>Sunna</i> or custom of the Prophet,
are the <i>Sunan</i> of Ab&uacute; D&aacute;w&uacute;d al-Sijist&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;889 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
the <i>J&aacute;mi&#8216;</i> of Ab&uacute; &#8216;Is&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad al-Tirmidh&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;892 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the <i>Sunan</i> of al-Nas&aacute;&#8217;&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;915 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
and the <i>Sunan</i> of Ibn M&aacute;ja (&#8224;&nbsp;896 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). These, together
with the <i>&#7778;a&#7717;&iacute;&#7717;s</i> of Bukh&aacute;r&iacute; and Muslim, form the Six Canonical
Books (<i>al-kutub al-sitta</i>), which are held in the highest
veneration. Amongst the innumerable works of a similar
kind produced in this period it will suffice to mention the
<i>Ma&#7779;&aacute;b&iacute;&#7717;u &#8217;l-Sunna</i> by al-Baghaw&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 1120 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). A
later adaptation called <i>Mishk&aacute;tu &#8217;l-Ma&#7779;&aacute;b&iacute;&#7717;</i> has been often
printed, and is still extremely popular.</p>

<p>Omitting the great manuals of Moslem Jurisprudence,
which are without literary interest in the larger sense, we
may pause for a moment at the name of al-M&aacute;ward&iacute;, a
Sh&aacute;fi&#8216;ite lawyer, who wrote a well-known treatise on politics&mdash;the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_338" id="Page_338" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>338</a></span>

<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-A&#7717;k&aacute;m al-Sul&#7789;&aacute;niyya</i>, or 'Book of the Principles
of Government.' His standpoint is purely theoretical.
Thus he lays down that the Caliph should be <span class="sidenote">M&aacute;ward&iacute;

elected by the body of learned, pious, and orthodox
divines, and that the people must leave the administration
of the State to the Caliph absolutely, as being its
representative. M&aacute;ward&iacute; lived at Baghd&aacute;d during the period
of Buwayhid ascendancy, a period described by Sir W. Muir
in the following words: "The pages of our annalists are now
almost entirely occupied with the political events of the day,
in the guidance of which the Caliphs had seldom any concern,
and which therefore need no mention here."<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> Under the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid dynasty the mystical doctrines of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s were
systematised and expounded. Some of the most important
Arabic works of reference on &#7778;&uacute;fiism are the <i>Q&uacute;tu &#8217;l-Qul&uacute;b</i>, or
'Food of Hearts,' by Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib al-Makk&iacute; <span class="sidenote"> Arabic authorities

Ab&uacute; &#7716;&aacute;mid al-Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;, surnamed 'the Proof
of Islam' (<i>&#7716;ujjatu &#8217;l-Isl&aacute;m</i>). He is a figure
of such towering importance that some detailed account of
his life and opinions must be inserted in a book like this,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_339" id="Page_339" href="#"><span><i>GHAZ&Aacute;L&Iacute;</i></span>339</a></span>

which professes to illustrate the history of Mu&#7717;ammadan
thought. Here, however, we shall only give an outline of his
biography in order to pave the way for discussion of his intellectual
achievements and his far-reaching influence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In this year (505 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 1111 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) died the Im&aacute;m, who was the

took place on the 14th of the Latter Jum&aacute;d&aacute; at &#7788;&aacute;bar&aacute;n,
a village near &#7788;&uacute;s. He was then fifty-five
years of age. Ghazz&aacute;l&iacute; is equivalent to Ghazz&aacute;l, like
&#8216;A&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;r&iacute; (for &#8216;A&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;r) and Khabb&aacute;z&iacute; (for Khabb&aacute;z), in the dialect of the

Al-Isnaw&iacute; says in his <i>&#7788;abaq&aacute;t</i><a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a>:&mdash;Ghazz&aacute;l&iacute; is an Im&aacute;m by whose
name breasts are dilated and souls are revived, and in whose literary
productions the ink-horn exults and the paper quivers with joy; and
at the hearing thereof voices are hushed and heads are bowed. He
was born at &#7788;&uacute;s in the year 450 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 1058-1059 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> His father
used to spin wool (<i>yaghzilu &#8217;l-&#7779;&uacute;f</i>) and sell it in his shop. On his deathbed
he committed his two sons, Ghazz&aacute;l&iacute; himself and his brother
A&#7717;mad, to the care of a pious &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, who taught them writing and
educated them until the money left him by their father was all spent.
'Then,' says Ghazz&aacute;l&iacute;, 'we went to the college to learn divinity
(<i>fiqh</i>) so that we might gain our livelihood.' After studying there
for some time he journeyed to Ab&uacute; Na&#7779;r al-Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute; in Jurj&aacute;n, then
to the Im&aacute;mu &#8217;l-&#7716;aramayn<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> at Nays&aacute;b&uacute;r, under whom he studied
with such assiduity that he became the best scholastic of his
contemporaries (<i>&#7779;&aacute;ra an&#7827;ara ahli zam&aacute;nihi</i>), and he lectured <i>ex</i>

death of his master he set out for the Camp<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> and presented himself
to the Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu &#8217;l-Mulk, whose assembly was the alighting-place of
the learned and the destination of the leading divines and savants;
and there, as was due to his high merit, he enjoyed the society of the
principal doctors, and disputed with his opponents and rebutted
them in spite of their eminence. So the Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu &#8217;l-Mulk inclined to
him and showed him great honour, and his name flew through the
world. Then, in the year '84 (1091 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) he was called to a professorship
in the Ni&#7827;&aacute;miyya College at Baghd&aacute;d, where a splendid
reception awaited him. His words reached far and wide, and his
influence soon exceeded that of the Em&iacute;rs and Viziers. But at last
his lofty spirit recoiled from worldly vanities. He gave himself up
to devotion and dervishhood, and set out, in the year '88 (1095 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
for the &#7716;ij&aacute;z.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> On his return from the Pilgrimage he journeyed to
Damascus and made his abode there for ten years in the minaret of
the Congregational Mosque, and composed several works, of which
the <i>I&#7717;y&aacute;</i> is said to be one. Then, after visiting Jerusalem and
Alexandria, he returned to his home at &#7788;&uacute;s, intent on writing and
worship and constant recitation of the Koran and dissemination of
knowledge and avoidance of intercourse with men. The Vizier
Fakhru &#8217;l-Mulk,<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> son of the Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu &#8217;l-Mulk, came to see him, and

which he expounds theology and the ethics of religion from

works.</span>
the standpoint of the moderate &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; school,
Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute; wrote a great number of important
works, such as the <i>Munqidh mina &#8217;l-&#7692;al&aacute;l</i>, or
'Deliverer from Error,' a sort of 'Apologia pro Vit&acirc; Su&acirc;'; the
<i>K&iacute;miy&aacute;&#8217;u &#8217;l-Sa&#8216;&aacute;dat</i>, or 'Alchemy of Happiness,' which was

originally written in Persian; and the <i>Tah&aacute;futu &#8217;l-Fal&aacute;sifa</i>, or
'Collapse of the Philosophers,' a polemical treatise designed to
refute and destroy the doctrines of Moslem philosophy. This
work called forth a rejoinder from the celebrated Ibn Rushd
(Averroes), who died at Morocco in 1198-1199 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>Here we may notice two valuable works on the history of
religion, both of which are generally known as <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Milal
wa-&#8217;l-Ni&#7717;al</i>,<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> that is to say, 'The Book of Religions
and Sects,' by Ibn &#7716;azm of Cordova (&#8224;&nbsp;1064 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
and Abu &#8217;l-Fat&#7717; al-Shahrast&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1153 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). <span class="sidenote"> Shahrast&aacute;n&iacute;'s
'Book of Religions
and Sects.'</span>
Ibn &#7716;azm we shall meet with again in the chapter which
deals specially with the history and literature of the Spanish
Moslems. Shahrast&aacute;n&iacute;, as he is named after his birthplace,
belonged to the opposite extremity of the Mu&#7717;ammadan
Empire, being a native of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, the huge Eastern
province bounded by the Oxus. Cureton, who edited the
Arabic text of the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Milal wa-&#8217;l-Ni&#7717;al</i> (London, 1842-1846),
gives the following outline of its contents:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After five introductory chapters, the author proceeds to arrange
his book into two great divisions; the one comprising the Religious,
the other the Philosophical Sects. The former of these contains an
account of the various Sects of the followers of Mu&#7717;ammad, and
likewise of those to whom a true revelation had been made (the
<i>Ahlu &#8217;l-Kit&aacute;b</i>, or 'People of the Scripture'), that is, Jews and
Christians; and of those who had a doubtful or pretended revelation
(<i>man lah&uacute; shubhatu &#8217;l-Kit&aacute;b</i>), such as the Magi and the Manich&aelig;ans.
The second division comprises an account of the philosophical
opinions of the Sab&aelig;ans (&#7778;&aacute;bians), which are mainly set forth in a
very interesting dialogue between a Sab&aelig;an and an orthodox
Mu&#7717;ammadan; of the tenets of various Greek Philosophers and
some of the Fathers of the Christian Church; and also of the
Mu&#7717;ammadan doctors, more particularly of the system of Ibn S&iacute;n&aacute;
or Avicenna, which the author explains at considerable length.
The work terminates with an account of the tenets of the Arabs
before the commencement of Islamism, and of the religion of the
people of India.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_342" id="Page_342" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>342</a></span>

The science of grammar took its rise in the cities of Ba&#7779;ra
and K&uacute;fa, which were founded not long after Mu&#7717;ammad's
death, and which remained the chief centres of Arabian life
<span class="sidenote"> Grammar and
philology.</span>
and thought outside the peninsula until they
were eclipsed by the great &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid capital. In
both towns the population consisted of Bedouin
Arabs, belonging to different tribes and speaking many
different dialects, while there were also thousands of artisans
and clients who spoke Persian as their mother-tongue, so that
the classical idiom was peculiarly exposed to corrupting
influences. If the pride and delight of the Arabs in their
noble language led them to regard the maintenance of its
purity as a national duty, they were equally bound by their
religious convictions to take decisive measures for ensuring the
correct pronunciation and interpretation of that "miracle of
Divine eloquence," the Arabic Koran. To this latter motive
the invention of grammar is traditionally ascribed. The
inventor is related to have been Abu &#8217;l-Aswad al-Du&#8217;il&iacute;, who
died at Ba&#7779;ra during the Umayyad period. "Abu <span class="sidenote"> The invention
of Arabic
grammar.</span>
&#8217;l-Aswad, having been asked where he had
acquired the science of grammar, answered that
he had learned the rudiments of it from &#8216;Al&iacute; b. Ab&iacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib. It
is said that he never made known any of the principles which
he had received from &#8216;Al&iacute; till Ziy&aacute;d<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> sent to him the order to
compose something which might serve as a guide to the
public and enable them to understand the Book of God. He
at first asked to be excused, but on hearing a man recite the
following passage out of the Koran, <i>anna &#8217;ll&aacute;ha bar&iacute;<sup>un</sup> mina
&acute;l-mushrik&iacute;na wa-ras&uacute;luhu</i>,<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> which last word the reader pronounced

burned all his collections of old poetry, &amp;c., and abandoned
himself to devotion; Khal&iacute;l b. A&#7717;mad, inventor of the Arabic
system of metres and author of the first Arabic lexicon (the
<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-&#8216;Ayn</i>), which, however, he did not live to complete;
the Persian S&iacute;bawayhi, whose Grammar, entitled 'The Book
of S&iacute;bawayhi,' is universally celebrated; the great Humanists

work, the <i>K&aacute;mil</i>, has been edited by Professor William

and critic of old Arabian poetry; and Ibn Durayd (&#8224;&nbsp;934 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
a distinguished philologist, genealogist, and poet, who received
a pension from the Caliph Muqtadir in recognition of
his services on behalf of science, and whose principal works,
in addition to the famous ode known as the <i>Maq&#7779;&uacute;ra</i>, are a
voluminous lexicon (<i>al-Jamhara fi &#8217;l-Lugha</i>) and a treatise on
the genealogies of the Arab tribes (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Ishtiq&aacute;q</i>).</p>

before his eyes, he made mistakes.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> Our knowledge of
Arabian antiquity is drawn, to a large extent, from the
traditions collected by him which are preserved in the <i>Kit&aacute;bu
&#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i> and elsewhere. He left nearly two hundred works,
of which a long but incomplete catalogue occurs in the <i>Fihrist</i>
(pp. 53-54). Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda was summoned by the Caliph <span class="sidenote">A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute;.</span>
H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d to Baghd&aacute;d, where he became acquainted
with A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute;. There was a standing feud between
them, due in part to difference of character<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a>
and in part to personal jealousies. &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Malik b. Qurayb
al-A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute; was, like his rival, a native of Ba&#7779;ra. Although he
may have been excelled by others of his contemporaries in certain
branches of learning, none exhibited in such fine perfection
the varied literary culture which at that time was so highly
prized and so richly rewarded. Whereas Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubayda was
dreaded for his sharp tongue and sarcastic humour, A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute;
had all the accomplishments and graces of a courtier. Ab&uacute;
Nuw&aacute;s, the first great poet of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period, said that
A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute; was a nightingale to charm those who heard him
with his melodies. In court circles, where the talk often
turned on philological matters, he was a favourite guest, and
the Caliph would send for him to decide any abstruse question
connected with literature which no one present was able to
answer. Of his numerous writings on linguistic and antiquarian
themes several have come down to us, <i>e.g.</i>, 'The Book
of Camels' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Ibil</i>), 'The Book of Horses' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu
&#8217;l-Khayl</i>), and 'The Book of the Making of Man' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu
Khalqi &#8217;l-Ins&aacute;n</i>), a treatise which shows that the Arabs of the
desert had acquired a considerable knowledge of human
anatomy. His work as editor, commentator, and critic of
Arabian poetry forms (it has been said) the basis of nearly all
that has since been written on the subject.</p>

Belles-lettres (<i>Adab</i>) and literary history are represented by
a whole series of valuable works. Only a few of the most

(&#8224;&nbsp;<i>circa</i> 760 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
important can be mentioned here, and that in a
very summary manner. The Persian R&uacute;zbih,
better known as &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h Ibnu &#8217;l-Muqaffa&#8216;, who
was put to death by order of the Caliph Man&#7779;&uacute;r, made several
translations from the Pehlev&iacute; or Middle-Persian literature into
Arabic. We possess a specimen of his powers in the famous
<i>Book of Kal&iacute;la and Dimna</i>, which is ultimately derived from
the Sanscrit <i>Fables of Bidpai</i>. The Arabic version is one of
the oldest prose works in that language, and is justly regarded
as a model of elegant style, though it has not the pungent
brevity which marks true Arabian eloquence. Ibn <span class="sidenote">Ibn Qutayba
(&#8224;&nbsp;899 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Qutayba, whose family came from Merv, held for
a time the office of Cadi at D&iacute;nawar, and lived at
Baghd&aacute;d in the latter half of the ninth century. We have more
than once cited his 'Book of General Knowledge' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu

(&#8224;&nbsp;869 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
freethinker, and gave his name to a sect of the

numerous books of an anecdotal and entertaining character.
Ibn Khallik&aacute;n singles out as his finest and most instructive
works the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-&#7716;ayaw&aacute;n</i> ('Book of Animals'), and the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_347" id="Page_347" href="#"><span><i>BELLES-LETTRES</i></span>347</a></span>
<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Bay&aacute;n wa-&#8217;l-Taby&iacute;n</i> ('Book of Eloquence and
Exposition'), which is a popular treatise on rhetoric. It so
happens&mdash;and the fact is not altogether fortuitous&mdash;that
extremely valuable contributions to the literary history of the
Arabs were made by two writers connected with the <span class="sidenote">Ibn &#8216;Abdi Rabbihi
(&#8224;&nbsp;940 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Umayyad House. Ibn &#8216;Abdi Rabbihi of Cordova,
who was descended from an enfranchised slave of
the Spanish Umayyad Caliph, Hish&aacute;m b. &#8216;Abd
al-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n (788-796 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), has left us a miscellaneous
anthology entitled <i>al-&#8216;Iqd al-Far&iacute;d</i>, or 'The Unique Necklace,'
which is divided into twenty-five books, each bearing
the name of a different gem, and "contains something on
every subject." Though Abu &#8217;l-Faraj &#8216;Al&iacute;, the <span class="sidenote">Abu &#8217;l-Faraj al-I&#7779;fah&aacute;n&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;967 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
author of the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, was born at
I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, he was an Arab of the Arabs, being a
member of the tribe Quraysh and a lineal descendant of
Marw&aacute;n, the last Umayyad Caliph. Coming to Baghd&aacute;d,
he bent all his energies to the study of Arabian antiquity,
and towards the end of his life found a generous patron in
al-Muhallab&iacute;, the Vizier of the Buwayhid sovereign, Mu&#8216;izzu
&#8217;l-Dawla. His minor works are cast in the shade by his
great 'Book of Songs.' This may be described as a history of
all the Arabian poetry that had been set to music down to
the author's time. It is based on a collection of one hundred
melodies which was made for the Caliph H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d,
but to these Abu &#8217;l-Faraj has added many others chosen by
himself. After giving the words and the airs attached to
them, he relates the lives of the poets and musicians by whom
they were composed, and takes occasion to introduce a vast
quantity of historical traditions and anecdotes, including much
ancient and modern verse. It is said that the &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ib Ibn
&#8216;Abb&aacute;d,<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> when travelling, used to take thirty camel-loads of
books about with him, but on receiving the <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i> he contented
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_348" id="Page_348" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>348</a></span>
himself with this one book and dispensed with all the
rest.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> The chief man of letters of the next generation was
Ab&uacute; Mans&uacute;r al-Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; (the Furrier) of Nays&aacute;b&uacute;r. <span class="sidenote">Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1037 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Notwithstanding that most of his works
are unscientific compilations, designed to amuse
the public rather than to impart solid instruction, his famous
anthology of recent and contemporary poets&mdash;the <i>Yat&iacute;matu
&#8217;l-Dahr</i>, or 'Solitaire of the Time'&mdash;supplies indubitable
proof of his fine scholarship and critical taste. Successive
continuations of the <i>Yat&iacute;ma</i> were written by al-B&aacute;kharz&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1075 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) in the <i>Dumyatu &#8217;l-Qa&#7779;r</i>, or 'Statue of the
Palace'; by Abu &#8217;l-Ma&#8216;&aacute;l&iacute; al-&#7716;a&#7827;&iacute;r&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1172 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) in the
<i>Z&iacute;natu &#8217;l-Dahr</i>, or 'Ornament of the Time'; and by the
favourite of Saladin, &#8216;Im&aacute;du &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-K&aacute;tib al-I&#7779;fah&aacute;n&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1201 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in the <i>Khar&iacute;datu &#8217;l-Qa&#7779;r</i>, or 'Virgin Pearl of the
Palace.' From the tenth century onward the study of philology
proper began to decline, while on the other hand those sciences
which formerly grouped themselves round philology now
became independent, were cultivated with brilliant success,
and in a short time reached their zenith.</p>

<p class="tb">The elements of History are found (1) in Pre-islamic traditions
and (2) in the <i>&#7716;ad&iacute;th</i> of the Prophet, but the idea of
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
historical composition on a grand scale was probably
suggested to the Arabs by Persian models
such as the Pehlev&iacute; <i>Khud&aacute;y-n&aacute;ma</i>, or 'Book of Kings,' which
Ibnu &#8217;l-Muqaffa&#8216; turned into Arabic in the eighth century
of our era under the title of <i>Siyaru Mul&uacute;ki &#8217;l-&#8216;Ajam</i>, that is,
'The History of the Kings of Persia.'</p>

<p>Under the first head Hish&aacute;m Ibnu &#8217;l-Kalb&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;819 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
and his father Mu&#7717;ammad deserve particular mention as painstaking
and trustworthy recorders.</p>

<p>Historical traditions relating to the Prophet were put in

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_349" id="Page_349" href="#"><span><i>BIOGRAPHERS AND HISTORIANS</i></span>349</a></span>

writing at an early date (see p. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>). The first biography of
Mu&#7717;ammad (<i>S&iacute;ratu Ras&uacute;li &#8217;ll&aacute;h</i>), compiled by Ibn Is&#7717;&aacute;q,
<span class="sidenote"> Histories of the
Prophet and his
Companions.</span>
who died in the reign of Man&#7779;&uacute;r (768 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
has come down to us only in the recension
made by Ibn Hish&aacute;m (&#8224;&nbsp;834 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). This work
as well as those of al-W&aacute;qid&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;823 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and Ibn Sa&#8216;d
(&#8224;&nbsp;845 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) have been already noticed.</p>

<p>Other celebrated historians of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period are the
following.</p>

<p class="tb">A&#7717;mad b. Ya&#7717;y&aacute; al-Bal&aacute;dhur&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;892 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), a Persian, wrote
an account of the early Mu&#7717;ammadan conquests (<i>Kit&aacute;bu
<span class="sidenote"> Bal&aacute;dhur&iacute;.</span>
Fut&uacute;&#7717;i &acute;l-Buld&aacute;n</i>), which has been edited by
De Goeje, and an immense chronicle based on
genealogical principles, 'The Book of the Lineages of the
Nobles' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu Ans&aacute;bi &#8217;l-Ashr&aacute;f</i>), of which two volumes are
extant.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></p>

<p>Ab&uacute; &#7716;&aacute;n&iacute;fa A&#7717;mad al-D&iacute;nawar&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;895 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) was also of
&Iacute;r&aacute;nian descent. His 'Book of Long Histories' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu
<span class="sidenote"> D&iacute;nawar&iacute;.</span>
&#8217;l-Akhb&aacute;r al-&#7788;iw&aacute;l</i>) deals largely with the
national legend of Persia, and is written throughout
from the Persian point of view.</p>

<p>Ibn W&aacute;&#7693;i&#7717; al-Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b&iacute;, a contemporary of D&iacute;nawar&iacute;, produced
an excellent compendium of universal history, which
<span class="sidenote">Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b&iacute;.</span>
is specially valuable because its author, being a
follower of the House of &#8216;Al&iacute;, has preserved the
ancient and unfalsified Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite tradition. His work has been
edited in two volumes by Professor Houtsma (Leyden, 1883).</p>

<p class="tb">The Annals of &#7788;abar&iacute;, edited by De Goeje and other
European scholars (Leyden, 1879-1898), and the Golden
Meadows<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> (<i>Mur&uacute;ju &#8217;l-Dhahab</i>) of Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;, which Pavet de

Courteille and Barbier de Meynard published with a French
translation (Paris, 1861-1877), have been frequently cited in
the foregoing pages; and since these two authors are not only
the greatest historians of the Mu&#7717;ammadan East but also
(excepting, possibly, Ibn Khald&uacute;n) the most eminent of all
who devoted themselves to this branch of Arabic literature,
we must endeavour to make the reader more closely acquainted
with them.</p>

<p>Ab&uacute; Ja&#8216;far Mu&#7717;ammad b. Jar&iacute;r was born in 838-839 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> at
&Aacute;mul in &#7788;abarist&aacute;n, the mountainous province lying along
<span class="sidenote">&#7788;abar&iacute; (838-923
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
the south coast of the Caspian Sea; whence the
name, &#7788;abar&iacute;, by which he is usually known.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a>
At this time &#8216;Ir&aacute;q was still the principal focus of
Mu&#7717;ammadan culture, so that a poet could say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"I see a man in whom the secretarial dignity is manifest,</span><span class="i0">
One who displays the brilliant culture of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q."<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thither the young &#7788;abar&iacute; came to complete his education.
He travelled by way of Rayy to Baghd&aacute;d, visited other
neighbouring towns, and extended his tour to Syria and
Egypt. Although his father sent him a yearly allowance, it did
not always arrive punctually, and he himself relates that on one
occasion he procured bread by selling the sleeves of his shirt.
Fortunately, at Baghd&aacute;d he was introduced to &#8216;Ubaydull&aacute;h b.
Ya&#7717;y&aacute;, the Vizier of Mutawakkil, who engaged him as tutor for
his son. How long he held this post is uncertain, but he was only
twenty-three years of age when his patron went out of office.
Fifteen years later we find him, penniless once more, in Cairo
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_351" id="Page_351" href="#"><span><i>&#7788;ABAR&Iacute;</i></span>351</a></span>
(876-877 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). He soon, however, returned to Baghd&aacute;d,
where he passed the remainder of his life in teaching and
writing. Modest, unselfish, and simple in his habits, he diffused
his encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge with an almost superhuman
industry. During forty years, it is said, he wrote forty leaves
every day. His great works are the <i>Ta&#8217;r&iacute;khu &acute;l-Rusul wa-&#8217;l-Mul&uacute;k</i>,
or 'Annals of the Apostles and the Kings,' and his
<i>Tafs&iacute;r</i>, or 'Commentary on the Koran.' Both, even in their
present shape, are books of enormous extent, yet it seems
likely that both were originally composed on a far larger
scale and were abbreviated by the author for general use. His
pupils, we are told, flatly refused to read the first editions with
him, whereupon he exclaimed: "Enthusiasm for learning is
dead!" The History of &#7788;abar&iacute;, from the Creation to the
year 302 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 915 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, is distinguished by "completeness of
detail, accuracy, and the truly stupendous learning of its author
that is revealed throughout, and that makes the Annals a vast
storehouse of valuable information for the historian as well as
for the student of Islam."<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> It is arranged chronologically,
the events being tabulated under the year (of the Mu&#7717;ammadan
era) in which they occurred. Moreover, it has a very peculiar
form. "Each important fact is related, if possible, by an
eye-witness or contemporary, whose account came down
through a series of narrators to the author. If he has obtained
more than one account of a fact, with more or less important
modifications, through several series of narrators, he communicates
them all to the reader <i>in extenso</i>. Thus we are
enabled to consider the facts from more than one point of
view, and to acquire a vivid and clear notion of them."<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a>
According to modern ideas, &#7788;abar&iacute;'s compilation is not so
much a history as a priceless collection of original documents
placed side by side without any attempt to construct a critical
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_352" id="Page_352" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>352</a></span>
and continuous narrative. At first sight one can hardly see the
wood for the trees, but on closer study the essential features
gradually emerge and stand out in bold relief from amidst the
multitude of insignificant circumstances which lend freshness
and life to the whole. &#7788;abar&iacute; suffered the common fate of
standard historians. His work was abridged and popularised,
the <i>isn&aacute;ds</i> or chains of authorities were suppressed, and the
various parallel accounts were combined by subsequent writers
into a single version.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> Of the Annals, as it left the author's
hands, no entire copy exists anywhere, but many odd volumes
are preserved in different parts of the world. The Leyden
edition is based on these scattered MSS., which luckily comprise
the whole work with the exception of a few not very
serious lacun&aelig;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Al&iacute; b. &#7716;usayn, a native of Baghd&aacute;d, was called Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;

to whom he traced his descent. Although we
possess only a small remnant of his voluminous
writings, no better proof can be desired of the
vast and various erudition which he gathered not from books
alone, but likewise from long travel in almost every part of
Asia. Among other places, he visited Armenia, India, Ceylon,
Zanzibar, and Madagascar, and he appears to have sailed in
Chinese waters as well as in the Caspian Sea. "My journey,"
he says, "resembles that of the sun, and to me the poet's verse
is applicable:&mdash;</p>

and an aged Copt, who, after giving his views as to the source
of the Nile and the construction of the Pyramids, defended his
faith (Christianity) on the ground of its manifest errors and contradictions,
arguing that its acceptance, in spite of these, by
so many peoples and kings was decisive evidence of its truth.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a>
Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;'s account of the Caliphs is chiefly remarkable for
the characteristic anecdotes in which it abounds. Instead
of putting together a methodical narrative he has thrown off
a brilliant but unequal sketch of public affairs and private
manners, of social life and literary history. Only considerations
of space have prevented me from enriching this volume with
not a few pages which are as lively and picturesque as any in
Suetonius. His last work, the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Tanb&iacute;h wa-&#8217;l-Ishr&aacute;f</i>

by birth, he was enslaved in his childhood and sold to
a merchant of Baghd&aacute;d. His master gave him a good
education and frequently sent him on trading expeditions
to the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. After being enfranchised
in consequence of a quarrel with his benefactor, he supported
himself by copying and selling manuscripts. In 1219-1220 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
he encountered the Tartars, who had invaded Khw&aacute;rizm, and
"fled as naked as when he shall be raised from the dust of
the grave on the day of the resurrection." Further details of
his adventurous life are recorded in the interesting notice

As regards the philosophical and exact sciences the Moslems
naturally derived their ideas and material from Greek culture,
<span class="sidenote"> The foreign
sciences.</span>
which had established itself in Egypt, Syria, and
Western Asia since the time of Alexander's
conquests. When the Syrian school of Edessa
was broken up by ecclesiastical dissensions towards the end
of the fifth century of our era, the expelled savants took refuge
in Persia at the S&aacute;s&aacute;nian court, and Khusraw An&uacute;shirw&aacute;n, or
N&uacute;sh&iacute;rw&aacute;n (531-578 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)&mdash;the same monarch who welcomed
the Neo-platonist philosophers banished from Athens by Justinian&mdash;founded
an Academy at Jund&eacute;-sh&aacute;p&uacute;r in Kh&uacute;zist&aacute;n,
where Greek medicine and philosophy continued to be taught
down to &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid days. Another centre of Hellenism was the
city of &#7716;arr&aacute;n in Mesopotamia. Its inhabitants, Syrian heathens
who generally appear in Mu&#7717;ammadan history under the name
of '&#7778;abians,' spoke Arabic with facility and contributed in
no small degree to the diffusion of Greek wisdom. The work
of translation was done almost entirely by Syrians. In the
monasteries of Syria and Mesopotamia the <span class="sidenote"> Translations
from the
Greek.</span>
writings of Aristotle, Galen, Ptolemy, and other
ancient masters were rendered with slavish fidelity,
and these Syriac versions were afterwards retranslated
into Arabic. A beginning was made under the Umayyads,
who cared little for Islam but were by no means indifferent
to the claims of literature, art, and science. An
Umayyad prince, Kh&aacute;lid b. Yaz&iacute;d, procured the translation
of Greek and Coptic works on alchemy, and himself wrote
three treatises on that subject. The accession of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids
gave a great impulse to such studies, which found an enlightened
patron in the Caliph Man&#7779;&uacute;r. Works on logic and
medicine were translated from the Pehlev&iacute; by Ibnu &#8217;l-Muqaffa&#8216;
(&#8224;&nbsp;about 760 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and others. It is, however, the splendid
reign of Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n (813-833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) that marks the full vigour
of this Oriental Renaissance. Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n was no ordinary man.
Like a true Persian, he threw himself heart and soul into
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_359" id="Page_359" href="#"><span><i>TRANSLATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC WORKS</i></span>359</a></span>
theological speculations and used the authority of the Caliphate
to enforce a liberal standard of orthodoxy. His interest in
science was no less ardent. According to a story told in the
<i>Fihrist</i>,<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> he dreamed that he saw the venerable figure of
Aristotle seated on a throne, and in consequence <span class="sidenote">Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n's
encouragement
of the New Learning.</span>
of this vision he sent a deputation to the Roman
Emperor (Leo the Armenian) to obtain scientific
books for translation into Arabic. The Caliph's
example was followed by private individuals. Three brothers,
Mu&#7717;ammad, A&#7717;mad, and &#7716;asan, known collectively as the
Ban&uacute; M&uacute;s&aacute;, "drew translators from distant countries by the
offer of ample rewards<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> and thus made evident the marvels
of science. Geometry, engineering, the movements of the
heavenly bodies, music, and astronomy were the principal
subjects to which they turned their attention; but these were
only a small number of their acquirements."<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n installed
them, with Ya&#7717;y&aacute; b. Ab&iacute; Man&#7779;&uacute;r and other scientists,
in the House of Wisdom (<i>Baytu &#8217;l-&#7716;ikma</i>) at Baghd&aacute;d, an
institution which comprised a well-stocked library and an
astronomical observatory. Among the celebrated translators
of the ninth century, who were themselves conspicuous workers
in the new field, we can only mention the Christians Qus&#7789;&aacute; b.
L&uacute;q&aacute; and &#7716;unayn b. Is&#7717;&aacute;q, and the &#7778;&aacute;bian Th&aacute;bit b. Qurra.
It does not fall within the scope of this volume to consider
in detail the achievements of the Moslems in science and
philosophy. That in some departments they made valuable
additions to existing knowledge must certainly be granted,
but these discoveries count for little in comparison with the
debt which we owe to the Arabs as pioneers of learning and
bringers of light to medi&aelig;val Europe.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> Meanwhile it is only

possible to enumerate a few of the most eminent philosophers
and scientific men who lived during the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid age. The
reader will observe that with rare exceptions they were of
foreign origin.</p>

<p>The leading spirits in philosophy were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b b. Is&#7717;&aacute;q al-Kind&iacute;, a descendant of the princely
family of Kinda (see p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>). He was distinguished by his
<span class="sidenote"> Kind&iacute;.</span>
contemporaries with the title <i>Faylas&uacute;fu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab</i>,
'The Philosopher of the Arabs.' He flourished
in the first half of the ninth century.</p>

<p>2. Ab&uacute; Na&#7779;r al-F&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;950 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), of Turkish race, a
native of F&aacute;r&aacute;b in Transoxania. The later years of his life
<span class="sidenote"> F&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute;.</span>
were passed at Aleppo under the patronage of
Sayfu &#8217;l-Dawla. He devoted himself to the study
of Aristotle, whom Moslems agree with Dante in regarding
as "il maestro di color che sanno."</p>

<p>3. Ab&uacute; &#8216;Al&iacute; Ibn S&iacute;n&aacute; (Avicenna), born of Persian parents
at Kharmaythan, near Bukh&aacute;r&aacute;, in the year 980 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> As
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn S&iacute;n&aacute;.</span>
a youth he displayed extraordinary talents, so
that "in the sixteenth year of his age physicians
of the highest eminence came to read medicine with him
and to learn those modes of treatment which he had
discovered by his practice."<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> He was no quiet student,
like F&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute;, but a pleasure-loving, adventurous man of the
world who travelled from court to court, now in favour, now
in disgrace, and always writing indefatigably. His system
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_361" id="Page_361" href="#"><span><i>PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS</i></span>361</a></span>
of philosophy, in which Aristotelian and Neo-platonic theories
are combined with Persian mysticism, was well suited to
the popular taste, and in the East it still reigns supreme. His
chief works are the <i>Shif&aacute;</i> (Remedy) on physics, metaphysics,
&amp;c., and a great medical encyclop&aelig;dia entitled the
<i>Q&aacute;n&uacute;n</i> (Canon). Avicenna died in 1037 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>4. The Spanish philosophers, Ibn B&aacute;jja (Avempace), Ibn
&#7788;ufayl, and Ibn Rushd (Averroes), all of whom flourished in
the twelfth century after Christ.</p>

<p class="tb">The most illustrious name beside Avicenna in the history
of Arabian medicine is Ab&uacute; Bakr al-R&aacute;z&iacute; (Rhazes), a native of
<span class="sidenote">Medicine,
Astronomy,
and Mathematics.</span>
Rayy, near Teheran (&#8224;&nbsp;923 or 932 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). J&aacute;bir
b. &#7716;ayy&aacute;n of Tarsus (&#8224;&nbsp;about 780 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)&mdash;the
Geber of European writers&mdash;won equal renown
as an alchemist. Astronomy went hand in hand with astrology.
The reader may recognise al-Fargh&aacute;n&iacute;, Ab&uacute; Ma&#8216;shar of Balkh
(&#8224;&nbsp;885 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and al-Batt&aacute;n&iacute;, a &#7778;&aacute;bian of &#7716;arr&aacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;929 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
under the names of Alfraganus, Albumaser, and Albategnius,
by which they became known in the West. Ab&uacute; &#8216;Abdall&aacute;h
al-Khw&aacute;rizm&iacute;, who lived in the Caliphate of Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n, was
the first of a long line of mathematicians. In this science, as
also in Medicine and Astronomy, we see the influence of
India upon Mu&#7717;ammadan civilisation&mdash;an influence, however,
which, in so far as it depended on literary sources, was more
restricted and infinitely less vital than that of Greece. Only
a passing reference can be made to Ab&uacute; Ray&#7717;&aacute;n al-B&iacute;r&uacute;n&iacute;, a
native of Khw&aacute;rizm (Khiva), whose knowledge of the <span class="sidenote">B&iacute;r&uacute;n&iacute; 973-1048
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span></span>
sciences, antiquities, and customs of India was
such as no Moslem had ever equalled. His two
principal works, the <i>&Aacute;th&aacute;r al-B&aacute;qiya</i>, or 'Surviving
Monuments,' and the <i>Ta&#8217;r&iacute;khu &#8217;l-Hind</i>, or 'History of India,'
have been edited and translated into English by Dr. Sachau.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_362" id="Page_362" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>362</a></span>
Moslems during the earlier part of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period, and
also of the enormous losses which Arabic literature has suffered
through the destruction of thousands of books that are
known to us by nothing beyond their titles and the names of
their authors, may be gained from the <i>Fihrist</i>, <span class="sidenote">The <i>Fihrist</i>.</span>
or 'Index' of Mu&#7717;ammad b. Is&#7717;&aacute;q b. Ab&iacute; Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b
al-Nad&iacute;m al-Warr&aacute;q al-Baghd&aacute;d&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;995 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Regarding
the compiler we have no further information than is conveyed
in the last two epithets attached to his name: he was
a copyist of MSS., and was connected with Baghd&aacute;d either
by birth or residence; add that, according to his own statement
(p. 349, l. 14 sqq.), he was at Constantinople (<i>D&aacute;ru
&#8217;l-R&uacute;m</i>) in 988<span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>, the same year in which his work was
composed. He may possibly have been related to the famous
musician, Is&#7717;&aacute;q b. Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m al-Nad&iacute;m of Mosul (&#8224;&nbsp;849-850 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
but this has yet to be proved. At any rate we owe to his
industry a unique conspectus of the literary history of the
Arabs to the end of the fourth century after the Flight. The
<i>Fihrist</i> (as the author explains in his brief Preface) is "an
Index of the books of all nations, Arabs and foreigners alike,
which are extant in the Arabic language and script, on every
branch of knowledge; comprising information as to their
compilers and the classes of their authors, together with the
genealogies of those persons, the dates of their birth, the length
of their lives, the times of their death, the places to which
they belonged, their merits and their faults, since the beginning
of every science that has been invented down to the
present epoch: namely, the year 377 of the Hijra." As the
contents of the <i>Fihrist</i> (which considerably exceed the above
description) have been analysed in detail by G. Fl&uuml;gel
(<i>Z.D.M.G.</i>, vol. 13, p. 559 sqq.) and set forth in tabular
form by Professor Browne in the first volume of his <i>Literary
History of Persia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> I need only indicate the general arrangement

number of sections (<i>fun&uacute;n</i>). Ibnu &#8217;l-Nad&iacute;m discusses, in
the first place, the languages, scripts, and sacred books of
the Arabs and other peoples, the revelation of the Koran, the
order of its chapters, its collectors, redactors, and commentators.
Passing next to the sciences which, as we have seen,
arose from study of the Koran and primarily served as handmaids
to theology, he relates the origin of Grammar, and
gives an account of the different schools of grammarians with
the treatises which they wrote. The third discourse embraces
History, Belles-Lettres, Biography, and Genealogy; the fourth
treats of Poetry, ancient and modern. Scholasticism (<i>Kal&aacute;m</i>)
forms the subject of the following chapter, which contains
a valuable notice of the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s and their founder, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h
b. Maym&uacute;n, as also of the celebrated mystic, &#7716;usayn b.
Man&#7779;&uacute;r al-&#7716;all&aacute;j. From these and many other names redolent
of heresy the author returns to the orthodox schools of
Law&mdash;the M&aacute;likites, &#7716;anafites, Sh&aacute;fi&#8216;ites and &#7826;&aacute;hirites; then
to the jurisconsults of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;a, &amp;c. The seventh discourse
deals with Philosophy and 'the Ancient Sciences,' under which
head we find some curious speculations concerning their
origin and introduction to the lands of Islam; a list of translators
and the books which they rendered into Arabic; an
account of the Greek philosophers from Thales to Plutarch,
with the names of their works that were known to the Moslems;
and finally a literary survey of the remaining sciences,
such as Mathematics, Music, Astronomy, and Medicine.
Here, by an abrupt transition, we enter the enchanted domain
of Oriental fable&mdash;the <i>Haz&aacute;r Afs&aacute;n</i>, or Thousand Tales,
Kal&iacute;la and Dimna, the Book of Sindb&aacute;d, and the legends of
Rustam and Isfandiy&aacute;r; works on sorcery, magic, conjuring,
amulets, talismans, and the like. European savants have long
recognised the importance of the ninth discourse,<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> which is
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_364" id="Page_364" href="#"><span><i>POETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</i></span>364</a></span>
devoted to the doctrines and writings of the &#7778;&aacute;bians and the
Dualistic sects founded by Manes, Bardesanes, Marcion, Mazdak,
and other heresiarchs. The author concludes his work
with a chapter on the Alchemists (<i>al-K&iacute;miy&aacute;&#8217;&uacute;n</i>).</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>

<h5>ORTHODOXY, FREE-THOUGHT, AND MYSTICISM</h5>

<p>We have already given some account of the great political
revolution which took place under the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid dynasty, and
we have now to consider the no less vital influence <span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids
and Islam.</span>
of the new era in the field of religion. It will be
remembered that the House of &#8216;Abb&aacute;s came
forward as champions of Islam and of the oppressed and
persecuted Faithful. Their victory was a triumph for the
Mu&#7717;ammadan over the National idea. "They wished, as
they said, to revive the dead Tradition of the Prophet. They
brought the experts in Sacred Law from Med&iacute;na, which had
hitherto been their home, to Baghd&aacute;d, and always invited
their approbation by taking care that even political questions
should be treated in legal form and decided in accordance with
the Koran and the Sunna. In reality, however, they used Islam
only to serve their own interest. They tamed the divines at
their court and induced them to sanction the most objectionable
measures. They made the pious Opposition harmless by
leading it to victory. With the downfall of the Umayyads it
had gained its end and could now rest in peace."<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> There
is much truth in this view of the matter, but notwithstanding
the easy character of their religion, the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphs were
sincerely devoted to the cause of Islam and zealous to maintain
its principles in public life. They regarded themselves as the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_366" id="Page_366" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>366</a></span>
sovereign defenders of the Faith; added the Prophet's mantle
(<i>al-burda</i>) to those emblems of Umayyad royalty, the sceptre
and the seal; delighted in the pompous titles which their
flatterers conferred on them, <i>e.g.</i>, 'Vicegerent of God,'
'Sultan of God upon the Earth,' 'Shadow of God,' &amp;c.;
and left no stone unturned to invest themselves with the
attributes of theocracy, and to inspire their subjects with
veneration.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> Whereas the Umayyad monarchs ignored or
crushed Mu&#7717;ammadan sentiment, and seldom made any <span class="sidenote"> Influence of
theologians.</span>
attempt to conciliate the leading representatives
of Islam, the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids, on the other hand, not
only gathered round their throne all the most
celebrated theologians of the day, but also showed them every
possible honour, listened respectfully to their counsel, and
allowed them to exert a commanding influence on the administration
of the State.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> When M&aacute;lik b. Anas was summoned
by the Caliph H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d, who wished to hear him
recite traditions, M&aacute;lik replied, "People come to seek knowledge."
So H&aacute;r&uacute;n went to M&aacute;lik's house, and leaned against
the wall beside him. M&aacute;lik said, "O Prince of the Faithful,
whoever honours God, honours knowledge." Al-Rash&iacute;d arose
and seated himself at Malik's feet and spoke to him and heard
him relate a number of traditions handed down from the
Apostle of God. Then he sent for Sufy&aacute;n b. &#8216;Uyayna, and
Sufy&aacute;n came to him and sat in his presence and recited
traditions to him. Afterwards al-Rash&iacute;d said, "O M&aacute;lik, we
humbled ourselves before thy knowledge, and profited thereby,
but Sufy&aacute;n's knowledge humbled itself to us, and we got no
good from it."<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> Many instances might be given of the high
favour which theologians enjoyed at this time, and of the
lively interest with which religious topics were debated by the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_367" id="Page_367" href="#"><span><i>THE DIVINES AND THE GOVERNMENT</i></span>367</a></span>
Caliph and his courtiers. As the Caliphs gradually lost their
temporal sovereignty, the influence of the <i>&#8216;Ulam&aacute;</i>&mdash;the
doctors of Divinity and Law&mdash;continued to increase, so that
ere long they formed a privileged class, occupying in Islam
a position not unlike that of the priesthood in medi&aelig;val
Christendom.</p>

<p class="tb">It will be convenient to discuss the religious phenomena of
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period under the following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Rationalism and Free-thought.</p>

<p>II. The Orthodox Reaction and the rise of Scholastic
Theology.</p>

<p>III. The &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; Mysticism.</p>

<p class="tb">I. The first century of &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid rule was marked, as we
have seen, by a great intellectual agitation. All sorts of new
<span class="sidenote"> Rationalism and
Free-thought.</span>
ideas were in the air. It was an age of discovery
and awakening. In a marvellously brief space
the diverse studies of Theology, Law, Medicine,
Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, and Natural Science
attained their maturity, if not their highest development.
Even if some pious Moslems looked askance at the foreign
learning and its professors, an enlightened spirit generally
prevailed. People took their cue from the court, which
patronised, or at least tolerated,<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> scientific research as well as
theological speculation.</p>

<p>These circumstances enabled the Mu&#8216;tazilites (see p. <a href="#Page_222">222</a> sqq.)
to propagate their liberal views without hindrance, and finally
<span class="sidenote">The Mu&#8216;tazilites
and their
opponents.</span>
to carry their struggle against the orthodox party
to a successful issue. It was the same conflict
that divided Nominalists and Realists in the days
of Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Occam. As often
happens when momentous principles are at stake, the whole

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_368" id="Page_368" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>368</a></span>

controversy between Reason and Revelation turned on a
single question&mdash;"Is the Koran created or uncreated?" In
other terms, is it the work of God or the Word of God?
According to orthodox belief, it is uncreated and has existed
with God from all eternity, being in its present form merely
a transcript of the heavenly archetype.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> Obviously this conception
of the Koran as the direct and literal Word of
God left no room for exercise of the understanding, but
required of those who adopted it a dumb faith and a blind
fatalism. There were many to whom the sacrifice did not
seem too great. The Mu&#8216;tazilites, on the contrary, asserted
their intellectual freedom. It was possible, they said, to know
God and distinguish good from evil without any Revelation at
all. They admitted that the Koran was God's work, in the
sense that it was produced by a divinely inspired Prophet, but
they flatly rejected its deification. Some went so far as to
criticise the 'inimitable' style, declaring that it could be
surpassed in beauty and eloquence by the art of man.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a></p>

<p>The Mu&#8216;tazilite controversy became a burning question in
the reign of Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n (813-833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), a Caliph whose scientific
enthusiasm and keen interest in religious matters we have
already mentioned. He did not inherit the orthodoxy of his
father, H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d; and it was believed that he
was at heart a <i>zind&iacute;q</i>. His liberal tendencies would have been
wholly admirable if they had not been marred by excessive
intolerance towards those who held opposite views to his
own. In 833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the year of his death, he promulgated
a decree which bound all Moslems to accept the
Mu&#8216;tazilite doctrine as to the creation of the Koran on pain
of losing their civil rights, and at the same time he established
an inquisition (<i>mi&#7717;na</i>) in order to obtain the assent of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_369" id="Page_369" href="#"><span><i>THE MU&#8216;TAZILITES IN POWER</i></span>369</a></span>

the divines, judges, and doctors of law. Those who would
not take the test were flogged and threatened with the sword.
After Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n's death the persecution still went on, <span class="sidenote">Rationalism
adopted and put
in force by the
Caliph Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n.</span>
although it was conducted in a more moderate
fashion. Popular feeling ran strongly against the
Mu&#8216;tazilites. The most prominent figure in the
orthodox camp was the Im&aacute;m A&#7717;mad b. &#7716;anbal, who firmly
resisted the new dogma from the first. "But for him," says
the Sunnite historian, Abu &#8217;l-Ma&#7717;&aacute;sin, "the beliefs of a great
number would have been corrupted."<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> Neither threats nor
entreaties could shake his resolution, and when he was
scourged by command of the Caliph Mu&#8216;ta&#7779;im, the palace
was in danger of being wrecked by an angry mob which had
assembled outside to hear the result of the trial. The Mu&#8216;tazilite
dogma remained officially in force until it was abandoned
<span class="sidenote"> Mutawakkil
returns to
orthodoxy.</span>
by the Caliph W&aacute;thiq and once more declared
heretical by the cruel and bigoted Mutawakkil
(847 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). From that time to this the victorious
party have sternly suppressed every rationalistic movement in
Islam.</p>

<p>According to Steiner, the original Mu&#8216;tazilite heresy arose
in the bosom of Islam, independently of any foreign influence,
<span class="sidenote">The end of the
Mu&#8216;tazilites.</span>
but, however that may be, its later development
was largely affected by Greek philosophy. We
need not attempt to follow the recondite speculations
of Ab&uacute; Hudhayl al-&#8216;All&aacute;f (&#8224;&nbsp;about 840<span class="smcap"> a.d.</span>) of his
contemporaries, al-Na&#7827;&#7827;&aacute;m, Bishr b. al-Mu&#8216;tamir, and others,
and of the philosophical schools of Ba&#7779;ra and Baghd&aacute;d in which
the movement died away. Vainly they sought to replace the
Mu&#7717;ammadan idea of God as will by the Aristotelian conception
of God as law. Their efforts to purge the Koran of
anthropomorphism made no impression on the faithful, who
ardently hoped to see God in Paradise face to face. What
they actually achieved was little enough. Their weapons of
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_370" id="Page_370" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>370</a></span>
logic and dialectic were turned against them with triumphant
success, and scholastic theology was founded on the ruins of
Rationalism. Indirectly, however, the Mu&#8216;tazilite principles
leavened Mu&#7717;ammadan thought to a considerable extent and
cleared the way for other liberal movements, like the Fraternity
of the <i>Ikhw&aacute;nu &#8217;l-&#7778;af&aacute;</i>, which endeavoured to harmonise
authority with reason, and to construct a universal system of
religious philosophy.</p>

<p>These 'Brethren of Purity,'<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> as they called themselves, compiled
a great encyclop&aelig;dic work in fifty tractates (<i>Ras&aacute;&#8217;il</i>). Of
<span class="sidenote">The Ikhw&aacute;nu
&#8217;l-&#7778;af&aacute;.</span>
the authors, who flourished at Ba&#7779;ra towards the
end of the tenth century, five are known to us
by name: viz., Ab&uacute; Sulaym&aacute;n Mu&#7717;ammad b.
Ma&#8216;shar al-Bayusti or al-Muqaddas&iacute; (Maqdis&iacute;), Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan
&#8216;Al&iacute; b. H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Zanj&aacute;n&iacute;, Ab&uacute; A&#7717;mad al-Mihraj&aacute;n&iacute;, al-&#8216;Awf&iacute;,
and Zayd b. Rif&aacute;&#8216;a. "They formed a society for the pursuit
of holiness, purity, and truth, and established amongst themselves
a doctrine whereby they hoped to win the approval of
God, maintaining that the Religious Law was defiled by
ignorance and adulterated by errors, and that there was no
means of cleansing and purifying it except philosophy, which
united the wisdom of faith and the profit of research. They
held that a perfect result would be reached if Greek philosophy
were combined with Arabian religion. Accordingly they composed
fifty tracts on every branch of philosophy, theoretical as
well as practical, added a separate index, and entitled them the
'Tracts of the Brethren of Purity' (<i>Ras&aacute;&#8217;ilu Ikhw&aacute;n al-&#7778;af&aacute;</i>).
The authors of this work concealed their names, but circulated
it among the booksellers and gave it to the public. They
filled their pages with devout phraseology, religious parables,
metaphorical expressions, and figurative turns of style."<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_371" id="Page_371" href="#"><span><i>THE BRETHREN OF PURITY</i></span>371</a></span>
Nearly all the tracts have been translated into German by
Dieterici, who has also drawn up an epitome of the whole
encyclop&aelig;dia in his <i>Philosophie der Araber im X Jahrhundert</i>.
It would take us too long to describe the system of the <i>Ikhw&aacute;n</i>,
but the reader will find an excellent account of it in Stanley
Lane-Poole's <i>Studies in a Mosque</i>, 2nd ed., p. 176 sqq. The
view has recently been put forward that the Brethren of Purity
were in some way connected with the Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute; propaganda, and
that their eclectic idealism represents the highest teaching of
the F&aacute;timids, Carmathians, and Assassins. Strong evidence in
support of this theory is supplied by a MS. of the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale (No. 2309 in De Slane's Catalogue), which contains,
together with fragments of the <i>Ras&aacute;&#8217;il</i>, a hitherto unknown
tract entitled the <i>J&aacute;mi&#8216;a</i> or 'Summary.'<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> The latter purports
to be the essence and crown of the fifty <i>Ras&aacute;&#8217;il</i>, it is manifestly
Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;lite in character, and, assuming that it is genuine, we
may, I think, agree with the conclusions which its discoverer,
M. P. Casanova, has stated in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Surtout je crois &ecirc;tre dans le vrai en affirmant que les doctrines
philosophiques des Isma&iuml;liens sont contenues tout enti&egrave;res dans les
<span class="sidenote">The doctrines of
the Brethren of
Purity identical
with the esoteric
philosophy of the
Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s.</span>
Ep&icirc;tres des Fr&egrave;res de la Puret&eacute;. Et c&#8217;est ce qui explique 'la s&eacute;duction extraordinaire que la doctrine
exer&ccedil;ait sur des hommes s&eacute;rieux.'<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> En y ajoutant la
croyance en l'<i>im&aacute;m cach&eacute;</i> (<i>al-im&aacute;m al-mast&uacute;r</i>) qui doit
appara&icirc;tre un jour pour &eacute;tablir le bonheur universel,
elle r&eacute;alisait la fusion de toutes les doctrines id&eacute;alistes,
du messianisme et du platonisme. Tant que l'im&aacute;m restait cach&eacute;,
il s'y m&ecirc;lait encore une saveur de myst&egrave;re qui attachait les esprits
les plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s. . . . En tous cas, on peut affirmer que les Carmathes
et les Assassins ont &eacute;t&eacute; profond&eacute;ment calomni&eacute;s quand ils out &eacute;t&eacute;
accus&eacute;s par leurs adversaires d'ath&eacute;isme et de d&eacute;bauche. Le fetwa
d'Ibn Taimiyyah, que j'ai cit&eacute; plus haut, pr&eacute;tend que leur dernier
degr&eacute; dans l'initiation (<i>al-bal&aacute;gh al-akbar</i>) est la n&eacute;gation m&ecirc;me du
Cr&eacute;ateur. Mais la <i>dj&acirc;mi&#8216;at</i> que nous avons d&eacute;couverte est, comme
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_372" id="Page_372" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>372</a></span>
tout l'indique, le dernier degr&eacute; de la science des Fr&egrave;res de la Puret&eacute;
et des Isma&iuml;liens; il n'y a rien de fond&eacute; dans une telle accusation.
La doctrine apparait tr&egrave;s pure, tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;e, tr&egrave;s simple m&ecirc;me: je
rep&egrave;te que c'est une sorte de panth&eacute;isme m&eacute;caniste et esth&eacute;tique qui
est absolument oppos&eacute; au scepticisme et au mat&eacute;rialisme, car il repose
sur l'harmonie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de toutes les parties du monde, harmonie
voulue par le Cr&eacute;ateur parce qu'elle est la beaut&eacute; m&ecirc;me.</p>

<p>"Ma conclusion sera que nous avons l&agrave; un exemple de plus dans
l&#8217;histoire d'une doctrine tr&egrave;s pure et tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;e en th&eacute;orie, devenue,
entre les mains des fanatiques et des ambitieux, une source d'actes
monstrueux et m&eacute;ritant l'infamie qui est attach&eacute;e a ce nom historique
d'Assassins."</p></div>

<p>Besides the Mu&#8216;tazilites, we hear much of another class of
heretics who are commonly grouped together under the name
of <i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>.</p>

<p>"It is well known," says Goldziher,<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> "that the earliest
persecution was directed against those individuals who managed
<span class="sidenote">The <i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>.</span>
more or less adroitly to conceal under
the veil of Islam old Persian religious ideas.
Sometimes indeed they did not consider any disguise to be
necessary, but openly set up dualism and other Persian or
Manich&aelig;an doctrines, and the practices associated therewith,
against the dogma and usage of Islam. Such persons were
called <i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>, a term which comprises different shades of
heresy and hardly admits of simple definition. Firstly, there
are the old Persian families incorporated in Islam who, following
the same path as the Shu&#8216;&uacute;bites, have a <i>national interest</i> in the
revival of Persian religious ideas and traditions, and from this
point of view react against the <i>Arabian</i> character of the
Mu&#7717;ammadan system. Then, on the other hand, there are
freethinkers, who oppose in particular the stubborn dogma
of Islam, reject <i>positive religion</i>, and acknowledge only the
moral law. Amongst the latter there is developed a monkish
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_373" id="Page_373" href="#"><span><i>THE ZIND&Iacute;QS</i></span>373</a></span>
asceticism extraneous to Islam and ultimately traceable to
Buddhistic influences."</p>

<p>The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Government, which sought to enforce an
official standard of belief, was far less favourable to religious
liberty than the Umayyads had been. Orthodox and heretic
alike fell under its ban. While Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n harried pious Sunnites,
his immediate predecessors raised a hue and cry against <i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>.
The Caliph Mahd&iacute; distinguished himself by an organised persecution
of these enemies of the faith. He appointed a Grand Inquisitor
(<i>&#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ibu &#8217;l-Zan&aacute;diqa</i><a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> or <i>&#8216;Ar&iacute;fu &#8217;l-Zan&aacute;diqa</i>)
to discover and hunt them down. If they would <span class="sidenote">Persecution of
<i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>.</span>
not recant when called upon, they were put to
death and crucified, and their books<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> were cut to pieces with
knives.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> Mahd&iacute;'s example was followed by H&aacute;d&iacute; and H&aacute;r&uacute;n
al-Rash&iacute;d. Some of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids, however, were less severe.
Thus Kha&#7779;&iacute;b, Man&#7779;&uacute;r's physician, was a <i>Zind&iacute;q</i> who professed
Christianity,<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> and in the reign of Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n it became the mode
to affect Manich&aelig;an opinions as a mark of elegance and refinement.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></p>

<p>The two main types of <i>zandaqa</i> which have been described
above are illustrated in the contemporary poets, Bashsh&aacute;r b.
<span class="sidenote"> Bashsh&aacute;r b.
Burd.</span>
Burd and &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; b. &#8216;Abd al-Qudd&uacute;s. Bashsh&aacute;r
was born stone-blind. The descendant of a noble
Persian family&mdash;though his father, Burd, was a
slave&mdash;he cherished strong national sentiments and did not
attempt to conceal his sympathy with the Persian clients
(<i>Maw&aacute;l&iacute;</i>), whom he was accused of stirring up against their
Arab lords. He may also have had leanings towards Zoroastrianism,
but Professor Bevan has observed that there is no real
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_374" id="Page_374" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>374</a></span>
evidence for this statement,<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> though Zoroastrian or Manich&aelig;an
views are probably indicated by the fact that he used to dispute
with a number of noted Moslem theologians in Ba&#7779;ra, <i>e.g.</i>, with
W&aacute;&#7779;il b. &#8216;A&#7789;&aacute;, who started the Mu&#8216;tazilite heresy, and &#8216;Amr
b. &#8216;Ubayd. He and &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; b. &#8216;Abd al-Qudd&uacute;s were put to
death by the Caliph Mahd&iacute; in the same year (783 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>This &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; belonged by birth or affiliation to the Arab tribe
of Azd. Of his life we know little beyond the circumstance
<span class="sidenote">&#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; b. &#8216;Abd
al-Qudd&uacute;s.</span>
that he was for some time a street-preacher at
Ba&#7779;ra, and afterwards at Damascus. It is possible
that his public doctrine was thought dangerous,
although the preachers as a class were hand in glove with the
Church and did not, like the Lollards, denounce religious
abuses.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> His extant poetry contains nothing heretical, but is
wholly moral and didactic in character. We have seen, however,
in the case of Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;At&aacute;hiya, that Mu&#7717;ammadan
orthodoxy was apt to connect 'the philosophic mind' with
positive unbelief; and &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; appears to have fallen a victim to
this prejudice. He was accused of being a dualist (<i>thanaw&iacute;</i>),
<i>i.e.</i>, a Manich&aelig;an. Mahd&iacute;, it is said, conducted his examination
in person, and at first let him go free, but the poet's fate was
sealed by his confession that he was the author of the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute; al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute;, himself a bold and derisive critic of
Mu&#7717;ammadan dogmas, devotes an interesting section of his
<i>Ris&aacute;latu &#8217;l-Ghufr&aacute;n</i> to the <i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>, and says
many hard things about them, which were no <span class="sidenote">Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;
al-Ma&#8216;arr&iacute; on the
<i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>.</span>
doubt intended to throw dust in the eyes of a
suspicious audience. The wide scope of the term is shown
by the fact that he includes under it the pagan chiefs of
Quraysh; the Umayyad Caliph Wal&iacute;d b. Yaz&iacute;d; the poets
Di&#8216;bil, Ab&uacute; Nuw&aacute;s, Bashsh&aacute;r, and &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; b. &#8216;Abd al-Qudd&uacute;s;
Ab&uacute; Muslim, who set up the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid dynasty; the Persian
rebels, B&aacute;bak and M&aacute;zy&aacute;r; Afsh&iacute;n, who after conquering
B&aacute;bak was starved to death by the Caliph Mu&#8216;ta&#7779;im; the
Carmathian leader al-Jann&aacute;b&iacute;; Ibnu &#8217;l-R&aacute;wand&iacute;, whose work
entitled the <i>D&aacute;migh</i> was designed to discredit the 'miraculous'
style of the Koran; and &#7716;usayn b. Man&#7779;&uacute;r al-&#7716;all&aacute;j, the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;
martyr. Most of these, one may admit, fall within Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Al&aacute;&#8217;s
definition of the <i>Zind&iacute;qs</i>: "they acknowledge neither prophet
nor sacred book." The name <i>Zind&iacute;q</i>, which is applied by J&aacute;&#7717;i&#7827;
(&#8224;&nbsp;868 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) to certain wandering monks,<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> seems in the first instance
to have been used of Manes (<i>M&aacute;n&iacute;</i>) and his followers, and
is no doubt derived, as Professor Bevan has suggested, from the
<i>zadd&iacute;qs</i>, who formed an elect class in the Manich&aelig;an hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a></p>

<p>II. The official recognition of Rationalism as the State
religion came to an end on the accession of Mutawakkil
in 847 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> The new Caliph, who owed his throne to the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_376" id="Page_376" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>376</a></span>

Turkish Pr&aelig;torians, could not have devised a surer means
of making himself popular than by standing forward as the
<span class="sidenote"> The Orthodox
Reaction.</span>
avowed champion of the faith of the masses. He
persecuted impartially Jews, Christians, Mu&#8216;tazilites,
Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, and &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s&mdash;every one, in short,
who diverged from the narrowest Sunnite orthodoxy. The
Vizier Ibn Ab&iacute; Du&#8217;&aacute;d, who had shown especial zeal in his
conduct of the Mu&#8216;tazilite Inquisition, was disgraced, and the
bulk of his wealth was confiscated. In Baghd&aacute;d the followers of
A&#7717;mad b. &#7716;anbal went from house to house terrorising the
citizens,<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> and such was their fanatical temper that when &#7788;abar&iacute;,
the famous divine and historian, died in 923 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, they would not
allow his body to receive the ordinary rites of burial.<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> Finally,
in the year 935 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Caliph R&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; issued an edict denouncing
them in these terms: "Ye assert that your ugly, ill-favoured
faces are in the likeness of the Lord of Creation, and that your
vile exterior resembles His, and ye speak of the hand, the fingers,
the feet, the golden shoes, and the curly hair (of God), and of
His going up to Heaven and of His coming down to Earth....
The Commander of the Faithful swears a binding oath that
unless ye refrain from your detestable practices and perverse
tenets he will lay the sword to your necks and the fire to your
dwellings."<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> Evidently the time was ripe for a system which
should reconcile the claims of tradition and reason, avoiding
the gross anthropomorphism of the extreme &#7716;anbalites on the
one side and the pure rationalism of the advanced Mu&#8216;tazilites
(who were still a power to be reckoned with) on the other.
It is a frequent experience that great intellectual or religious
movements rising slowly and invisibly, in response, as it were,
to some incommunicable want, suddenly find a distinct interpreter
with whose name they are henceforth associated for
ever. The man, in this case, was Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan al-Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;.
He belonged to a noble and traditionally orthodox family of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_377" id="Page_377" href="#"><span><i>ABU &#8217;L-&#7716;ASAN AL-ASH&#8216;AR&Iacute;</i></span>377</a></span>

Yemenite origin. One of his ancestors was Ab&uacute; M&uacute;s&aacute;
al-Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, who, as the reader will recollect, played a somewhat
inglorious part in the arbitration between &#8216;Al&iacute; and <span class="sidenote">Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan
al-ash&#8216;ar&iacute;.</span>
Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya after the battle of &#7778;iff&iacute;n.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> Born in 873-874
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> at Ba&#7779;ra, a city renowned for its scientific
and intellectual fertility, the young Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan deserted the
faith of his fathers, attached himself to the freethinking school,
and until his fortieth year was the favourite pupil and intimate
friend of al-Jubb&aacute;&#8217;&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;915 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the head of the Mu&#8216;tazilite
party at that time. He is said to have broken with his teacher
in consequence of a dispute as to whether God always does
what is best (<i>a&#7779;la&#7717;</i>) for His creatures. The story is related as
follows by Ibn Khallik&aacute;n (De Slane's translation, vol. ii,
p. 669 seq.):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; proposed to Jubb&aacute;&#8217;&iacute; the case of three brothers, one of
whom was a true believer, virtuous and pious; the second an infidel,
a debauchee and a reprobate; and the third an infant: <span class="sidenote"> Story of the
three brothers.</span>
they all died, and Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; wished to know what had
become of them. To this Jubb&aacute;&#8217;&iacute; answered: "The
virtuous brother holds a high station in Paradise; the infidel
is in the depths of Hell, and the child is among those who
have obtained salvation."<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> "Suppose now," said Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, "that
the child should wish to ascend to the place occupied by his virtuous
brother, would he be allowed to do so?" "No," replied Jubb&aacute;&#8217;&iacute;,
"it would be said to him: 'Thy brother arrived at this place through
his numerous works of obedience towards God, and thou hast no
such works to set forward.'" "Suppose then," said Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, "that the
child say: 'That is not my fault; you did not let me live long
enough, neither did you give me the means of proving my obedience.'"
"In that case," answered Jubb&aacute;&#8217;&iacute;, "the Almighty would
say: 'I knew that if I had allowed thee to live, thou wouldst have
been disobedient and incurred the severe punishment (of Hell);
I therefore acted for thy advantage.'" "Well," said Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, "and
suppose the infidel brother were to say: 'O God of the universe!
since you knew what awaited him, you must have known what

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_378" id="Page_378" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>378</a></span>

awaited me; why then did you act for his advantage and not for
mine?" Jubb&aacute;&#8217;&iacute; had not a word to offer in reply.</p></div>

<p>Soon afterwards Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; made a public recantation. One
Friday, while sitting (as his biographer relates) in the chair
<span class="sidenote">Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;'s
conversion to
orthodoxy.</span>
from which he taught in the great mosque of
Ba&#7779;ra, he cried out at the top of his voice: "They
who know me know who I am: as for those
who do not know me I will tell them. I am &#8216;Al&iacute; b.
Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l al-Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, and I used to hold that the Koran was
created, that the eyes of men shall not see God, and that we
ourselves are the authors of our evil deeds. Now I have
returned to the truth; I renounce these opinions, and I undertake
to refute the Mu&#8216;tazilites and expose their infamy and
turpitude."<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a></p>

<p>These anecdotes possess little or no historical value, but
illustrate the fact that Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, having learned all that the
Mu&#8216;tazilites could teach him and having thoroughly mastered
their dialectic, turned against them with deadly force the
weapons which they had put in his hands. His doctrine on
the subject of free-will may serve to exemplify the method of
<i>Kal&aacute;m</i> (Disputation) by which he propped up the orthodox
creed.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> Here, as in other instances, Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; took <span class="sidenote">Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; as the
founder of
Scholastic
Theology.</span>
the central path&mdash;<i>medio tutissimus</i>&mdash;between two
extremes. It was the view of the early Moslem
Church&mdash;a view justified by the Koran and the
Apostolic Traditions&mdash;that everything was determined in
advance and inscribed, from all eternity, on the Guarded Tablet
(<i>al-Law&#7717; al-Ma&#7717;f&uacute;&#7827;</i>), so that men had no choice but to commit
the actions decreed by destiny. The Mu&#8216;tazilites, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_379" id="Page_379" href="#"><span><i>MOSLEM SCHOLASTICISM</i></span>379</a></span>
contrary, denied that God could be the author of evil and
insisted that men's actions were free. Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, on his part,
declared that all actions are created and predestined by God,
but that men have a certain subordinate power which enables
them to acquire the actions previously created, although it
produces no effect on the actions themselves. Human agency,
therefore, was confined to this process of acquisition (<i>kasb</i>).
With regard to the anthropomorphic passages in the Koran,
Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; laid down the rule that such expressions as "<i>The
Merciful has settled himself upon His throne</i>," "<i>Both His hands
are spread out</i>," &amp;c., must be taken in their obvious sense without
asking 'How?' (<i>bil&aacute; kayfa</i>). Spitta saw in the system of
Ash&#8216;ar&iacute; a successful revolt of the Arabian national spirit against
the foreign ideas which were threatening to overwhelm Islam,<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a>
a theory which does not agree with the fact that most of the
leading Ash&#8216;arites were Persians.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> Von Kremer came nearer
the mark when he said "Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;'s victory was simply a clerical
triumph,"<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> but it was also, as Schreiner has observed, "a
victory of reflection over unthinking faith."</p>

<p>The victory, however, was not soon or easily won.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> Many
of the orthodox disliked the new Scholasticism hardly less than
the old Rationalism. Thus it is not surprising to read in the
<i>K&aacute;mil</i> of Ibnu &#8217;l-Ath&iacute;r under the year 456 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 1063-4 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
that Alp Arsl&aacute;n's Vizier, &#8216;Am&iacute;du &#8217;l-Mulk al-Kundur&iacute;, having
obtained his master's permission to have curses pronounced
against the R&aacute;fi&#7693;ites (Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites) from the pulpits of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n,
included the Ash&#8216;arites in the same malediction, and that
the famous Ash&#8216;arite doctors, Abu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;sim al-Qushayr&iacute;
and the Im&aacute;mu &#8217;l-&#7716;aramayn Abu &#8217;l-Ma&#8216;&aacute;l&iacute; al-Juwayn&iacute;, left
the country in consequence. The great Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu &#8217;l-Mulk
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_380" id="Page_380" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>380</a></span>
exerted himself on behalf of the Ash&#8216;arites, and the Ni&#7827;&aacute;miyya
College, which he founded in Baghd&aacute;d in the year 1067 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
was designed to propagate their system of theology. But the
man who stamped it with the impression of his own powerful
genius, fixed its ultimate form, and established it as the
universal creed of orthodox Islam, was Ab&uacute; &#7716;&aacute;mid al-Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;
(1058-1111 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). We have already sketched the outward
course of his life, and need only recall that he lectured at Baghd&aacute;d
in the Ni&#7827;&aacute;miyya College for four years (1091-1095 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a>
At the end of that time he retired from the world as a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, and
so brought to a calm and fortunate close the long spiritual
travail which he has himself described in the <i>Munqidh mina
&#8217;l-&#7692;al&aacute;l</i>, or 'Deliverer from Error.'<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> We must now attempt
to give the reader some notion of this work, both on account of
its singular psychological interest and because Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;'s search
for religious truth exercised, as will shortly appear, a profound
and momentous influence upon the future history of Mu&#7717;ammadan
thought. It begins with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise
be to God by the praise of whom every written or spoken discourse
<span class="sidenote"> Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;'s
autobiography.</span>
is opened! And blessings on Mu&#7717;ammad, the Elect,
the Prophet and Apostle, as well as on his family and
his companions who lead us forth from error! To
proceed: You have asked me, O my brother in religion, to explain
to you the hidden meanings and the ultimate goal of the sciences,
and the secret bane of the different doctrines, and their inmost
depths. You wish me to relate all that I have endured in seeking
to recover the truth from amidst the confusion of sects with diverse
ways and paths, and how I have dared to raise myself from the
abyss of blind belief in authority to the height of discernment. You
desire to know what benefits I have derived in the first place from
Scholastic Theology, and what I have appropriated, in the second

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_381" id="Page_381" href="#"><span><i>GHAZ&Aacute;L&Iacute;</i></span>381</a></span>

place, from the methods of the Ta&#8216;l&iacute;mites<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> who think that truth can
be attained only by submission to the authority of an Im&aacute;m; and
thirdly, my reasons for spurning the systems of philosophy; and,
lastly, why I have accepted the tenets of &#7778;&uacute;fiism: you are anxious,
in short, that I should impart to you the essential truths which I
have learned in my repeated examination of the (religious) opinions
of mankind."</p></div>

<p>In a very interesting passage, which has been translated by
Professor Browne, Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute; tells how from his youth upward he
was possessed with an intense thirst for knowledge, which
impelled him to study every form of religion and philosophy,
and to question all whom he met concerning the nature and
meaning of their belief.<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> But when he tried to distinguish
the true from the false, he found no sure test. He could not
trust the evidence of his senses. The eye sees a shadow and
declares it to be without movement; or a star, and deems it
no larger than a piece of gold. If the senses thus deceive,
may not the mind do likewise? Perhaps our life is a dream
full of phantom thoughts which we mistake for realities&mdash;until
the awakening comes, either in moments of ecstasy or at
death. "For two months," says Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;, "I was actually,
though not avowedly, a sceptic." Then God gave him light,
so that he regained his mental balance and was able to think
soundly. He resolved that this faculty must guide him to the
truth, since blind faith once lost never returns. Accordingly,
he set himself to examine the foundations of belief in four
classes of men who were devoted to the search for truth,
namely, Scholastic Theologians, Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute;s (<i>B&aacute;tiniyya</i>), Philosophers,
and &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s. For a long while he had to be content
with wholly negative results. Scholasticism was, he admitted,
an excellent purge against heresy, but it could not cure the
disease from which he was suffering. As for the philosophers,
all of them&mdash;Materialists (<i>Dahriyy&uacute;n</i>), Naturalists (<i>&#7788;ab&iacute;&#8216;iyy&uacute;n</i>),

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_382" id="Page_382" href="#"><span><i>ORTHODOXY AND FREE-THOUGHT</i></span>382</a></span>

and Theists (<i>Il&aacute;hiyy&uacute;n</i>)&mdash;"are branded with infidelity and
impiety." Here, as often in his discussion of the philosophical
schools, Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;'s religious instinct breaks out. We cannot
imagine him worshipping at the shrine of pure reason any
more than we can imagine Herbert Spencer at Lourdes.
He next turned to the Ta&#8216;l&iacute;mites (Doctrinists) or B&aacute;&#7789;inites
(Esoterics), who claimed that they knew the truth, and that its
unique source was the infallible Im&aacute;m. But when he came to
close quarters with these sectaries, he discovered that they
could teach him nothing, and their mysterious Im&aacute;m vanished
into space. &#7778;&uacute;fiism, therefore, was his last hope. He carefully
studied the writings of the mystics, and as he read it became
clear to him that now he was on the right path. He saw
that the higher stages of &#7778;&uacute;fiism could not be learned by
study, but must be realised by actual experience, that is, by
rapture, ecstasy, and moral transformation. After a painful
struggle with himself he resolved to cast aside all his worldly
ambition and to live for God alone. In the month of Dhu
&#8217;l-Qa&#8216;da, 488 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> (November, 1095 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), he left Baghd&aacute;d
and wandered forth to Syria, where he found in the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; discipline
of prayer, praise, and meditation the peace which his
soul desired.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan B. Macdonald, to whom we owe the best and
fullest life of Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute; that has yet been written, sums up his
work and influence in Islam under four heads<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, he led men back from scholastic labours upon theological
dogmas to living contact with, study and exegesis of,
the Word and the Traditions.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, in his preaching and moral exhortations he re-introduced
the element of fear.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, it was by his influence that &#7778;&uacute;fiism attained a firm
and assured position within the Church of Islam.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_383" id="Page_383" href="#"><span><i>GHAZ&Aacute;L&Iacute;</i></span>383</a></span>

<i>Fourth</i>, he brought philosophy and philosophical theology
within the range of the ordinary mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Of these four phases of al-Ghazz&#257;l&#299;'s work," says Macdonald, "the
first and third are undoubtedly the most important. He made his
<span class="sidenote"> Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;'s work
and influence.</span>
mark by leading Islam back to its fundamental and historical
facts, and by giving a place in its system to the
emotional religious life. But it will have been noticed
that in none of the four phases was he a pioneer. He was not a
scholar who struck out a new path, but a man of intense personality
who entered on a path already trodden and made it the common
highway. We have here his character. Other men may have
been keener logicians, more learned theologians, more gifted
saints; but he, through his personal experiences, had attained so
overpowering a sense of the divine realities that the force of his
character&mdash;once combative and restless, now narrowed and intense&mdash;swept
all before it, and the Church of Islam entered on a new era
of its existence."</p></div>

<p>III. We have traced the history of Mysticism in Islam from
the ascetic movement of the first century, in which it originated,
<span class="sidenote">&#7778;&uacute;fiism in the
&#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period.</span>
to a point where it begins to pass beyond the
sphere of Mu&#7717;ammadan influence and to enter
on a strange track, of which the Prophet assuredly
never dreamed, although the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s constantly pretend that they
alone are his true followers. I do not think it can be maintained
that &#7778;&uacute;fiism of the theosophical and speculative type,
which we have now to consider, is merely a development of the
older asceticism and quietism which have been described in a
former chapter. The difference between them is essential and
must be attributed in part, as Von Kremer saw,<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> to the intrusion
of some extraneous, non-Islamic, element. As to the nature of
this new element there are several conflicting theories, which
have been so clearly and fully stated by Professor Browne in
his <i>Literary History of Persia</i> (vol. i, p. 418 sqq.) that I need
not dwell upon them here. Briefly it is claimed&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent3">(<i>a</i>) That &#7778;&uacute;fiism owes its inspiration to Indian philosophy,
and especially to the Vedanta.</p>

<p class="indent3">(<i>b</i>) That the most characteristic ideas in &#7778;&uacute;fiism are of
Persian origin.</p>

<p class="indent3">(<i>c</i>) That these ideas are derived from Neo-platonism.</p>

<p>Instead of arguing for or against any of the above theories,
all of which, in my opinion, contain a measure of truth, I
propose in the following pages to sketch the historical evolution
of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; doctrine as far as the materials at my disposal will
permit. This, it seems to me, is the only possible method by
which we may hope to arrive at a definite conclusion as to its
origin. Since mysticism in all ages and countries is fundamentally
the same, however it may be modified by its peculiar
environment, and by the positive religion to which it clings
for support, we find remote and unrelated systems showing
an extraordinarily close likeness and even coinciding in many
features of verbal expression. Such resemblances can prove
little or nothing unless they are corroborated by evidence
based on historical grounds. Many writers on &#7778;&uacute;fiism have
disregarded this principle; hence the confusion which long
prevailed. The first step in the right direction was made by
Adalbert Merx,<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> who derived valuable results from a chronological
examination of the sayings of the early &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s. He did
not, however, carry his researches beyond Ab&uacute; Sulaym&aacute;n
al-D&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;830 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and confined his attention almost
entirely to the doctrine, which, according to my view, should
be studied in connection with the lives, character, and nationality
of the men who taught it.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> No doubt the origin and
growth of mysticism in Islam, as in all other religions, <i>ultimately</i>
depended on general causes and conditions, not on external
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_385" id="Page_385" href="#"><span><i>PRINCIPLES OF INVESTIGATION</i></span>385</a></span>
circumstances. For example, the political anarchy of the
Umayyad period, the sceptical tendencies of the early &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
age, and particularly the dry formalism of Moslem
theology could not fail to provoke counter-movements towards
quietism, spiritual authority, and emotional faith. But although
&#7778;&uacute;fiism was not called into being by any impulse from without
(this is too obvious to require argument), the influences of
which I am about to speak have largely contributed to make
it what it is, and have coloured it so deeply that no student of
the history of &#7778;&uacute;fiism can afford to neglect them.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighth century of our era the
influence of new ideas is discernible in the sayings of Ma&#8216;r&uacute;f
<span class="sidenote">Ma&#8216;r&uacute;f al-Karkh&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;815 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
al-Karkh&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;815 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), a contemporary of Fu&#7693;ayl
b. &#8216;Iy&aacute;&#7693; and Shaq&iacute;q of Balkh. He was born in
the neighbourhood of W&aacute;si&#7789;, one of the great
cities of Mesopotamia, and the name of his father, F&iacute;r&uacute;z, or
F&iacute;r&uacute;z&aacute;n, shows that he had Persian blood in his veins. Ma&#8216;r&uacute;t
was a client (<i>mawl&aacute;</i>) of the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite Im&aacute;m, &#8216;Al&iacute; b. M&uacute;s&aacute;
al-Ri&#7693;&aacute;, in whose presence he made profession of Islam; for he
had been brought up as a Christian (such is the usual account),
or, possibly, as a &#7778;&aacute;bian. He lived during the reign of H&aacute;r&uacute;n
al-Rash&iacute;d in the Karkh quarter of Baghd&aacute;d, where he gained
a high reputation for saintliness, so that his tomb in that
city is still an object of veneration. He is described as a
God-intoxicated man, but in this respect he is not to be
compared with many who came after him. Nevertheless, he
deserves to stand at the head of the mystical as opposed to the
ascetic school of &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s. He defined &#7778;&uacute;fiism as "the apprehension
of Divine realities and renunciation of human possessions."<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a>
Here are a few of his sayings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent5">"Love is not to be learned from men; it is one of God's gifts and
comes of His grace.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_386" id="Page_386" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>386</a></span>

<p class="indent5">"The Saints of God are known by three signs: their thought is of
God, their dwelling is with God, and their business is in God.</p>

<p class="indent5">"If the gnostic (<i>&#8216;&aacute;rif</i>) has no bliss, yet he himself is in every bliss.</p>

<p class="indent5">"When you desire anything of God, swear to Him by me."</p></div>

<p>From these last words, which Ma&#8216;r&uacute;f addressed to his pupil
Sar&iacute; al-Saqa&#7789;&iacute;, it is manifest that he regarded himself as being
in the most intimate communion with God.</p>

<p>Ab&uacute; Sulaym&aacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;830 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the next great name in the
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; biographies, was also a native of W&aacute;si&#7789;, but afterwards
emigrated to Syria and settled at D&aacute;ray&aacute; (near <span class="sidenote">Ab&uacute; Sulaym&aacute;n
al-D&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;830 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Damascus), whence he is called 'al-D&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;.' He
developed the doctrine of gnosis (<i>ma&#8216;rifat</i>). Those
who are familiar with the language of European mystics&mdash;<i>illuminatio</i>,
<i>oculus cordis</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;will easily interpret such sayings
as these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent5">"None refrains from the lusts of this world save him in whose
heart there is a light that keeps him always busied with the next
world.</p>

<p class="indent5">"When the gnostic's spiritual eye is opened, his bodily eye is shut:
they see nothing but Him.</p>

<p class="indent5">"If Gnosis were to take visible form, all that looked thereon would
die at the sight of its beauty and loveliness and goodness and grace,
and every brightness would become dark beside the splendour
thereof.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></p>

<p class="indent5">"Gnosis is nearer to silence than to speech."</p></div>

<p>We now come to Dhu &#8217;l-N&uacute;n al-Misr&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;860 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), whom
the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s themselves consider to be the primary author of their
<span class="sidenote">Dhu &#8217;l-N&uacute;n

doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> That he at all events was among the
first of those who helped to give it permanent
shape is a fact which is amply attested by the
collection of his sayings preserved in &#8216;A&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;r's <i>Memoirs of the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_387" id="Page_387" href="#"><span><i>DHU &#8217;L-N&Uacute;N AL-MI&#7778;R&Iacute;</i></span>387</a></span>
<i>Saints</i> and in other works of the same kind.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> It is clear that
the theory of gnosis, with which he deals at great length, was
the central point in his system; and he seems to have introduced
the doctrine that true knowledge of God is attained only
by means of ecstasy (<i>wajd</i>). "The man that knows God
best," he said, "is the one most lost in Him." Like Dionysius,
he refused to make any positive statements about the Deity.
"Whatever you imagine, God is the contrary of that."
Divine love he regarded as an ineffable mystery which must
not be revealed to the profane. All this is the very essence
of the later &#7778;&uacute;fiism. It is therefore desirable to ascertain the
real character of Dhu &#8217;l-N&uacute;n and the influences to which he
was subjected. The following account gives a brief summary
of what I have been able to discover; fuller details will be found
in the article mentioned above.</p>

<p>His name was Abu &#8217;l-Fay&#7693; Thawb&aacute;n b. Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m, Dhu
&#8217;l-N&uacute;n (He of the Fish) being a sobriquet referring to one
of his miracles, and his father was a native of Nubia, or of
Ikhm&iacute;m in Upper Egypt. Ibn Khallik&aacute;n describes Dhu
&#8217;l-N&uacute;n as 'the nonpareil of his age' for learning, devotion,
communion with the Divinity (<i>&#7717;&aacute;l</i>), and acquaintance with
literature (<i>adab</i>); adding that he was a philosopher (<i>&#7717;ak&iacute;m</i>)
and spoke Arabic with elegance. The people of Egypt,
among whom he lived, looked upon him as a <i>zind&iacute;q</i> (freethinker),
and he was brought to Baghd&aacute;d to answer this
charge, but after his death he was canonised. In the <i>Fihrist</i>
he appears among "the philosophers who discoursed on
alchemy," and Ibnu &#8217;l-Qif&#7789;&iacute; brackets him with the famous
occultist J&aacute;bir b. &#7716;ayy&aacute;n. He used to wander (as we learn
from Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute;)<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> amidst the ruined Egyptian monuments,
studying the inscriptions and endeavouring to decipher the
mysterious figures which were thought to hold the key to the
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_388" id="Page_388" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>388</a></span>
lost sciences of antiquity. He also dabbled in medicine, which,
like Paracelsus, he combined with alchemy and magic.</p>

<p>Let us see what light these facts throw upon the origin of
the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; theosophy. Did it come to Egypt from India, Persia,
or Greece?</p>

<p>Considering the time, place, and circumstances in which it
arose, and having regard to the character of the man who
<span class="sidenote"> The origin of
theosophical
&#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
bore a chief part in its development, we cannot
hesitate, I think, to assert that it is largely a
product of Greek speculation. Ma&#8216;r&uacute;f al-Karkh&iacute;,
Ab&uacute; Sulaym&aacute;n al-D&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;, and Dhu &#8217;l-N&uacute;n al-Mi&#7779;r&iacute; all three
lived and died in the period (786-861 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) which begins with
the accession of H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d and is terminated by the
death of Mutawakkil. During these seventy-five years the
stream of Hellenic culture flowed unceasingly into the Moslem
world. Innumerable works of Greek philosophers, physicians,
and scientists were translated and eagerly studied. Thus the
Greeks became the teachers of the Arabs, and the wisdom of
ancient Greece formed, as has been shown in a preceding
chapter, the basis of Mu&#7717;ammadan science and philosophy.
The results are visible in the Mu&#8216;tazilite rationalism as well as
in the system of the <i>Ikhw&aacute;nu &#8217;l-&#7778;af&aacute;</i>. But it was not through
literature alone that the Moslems were imbued with Hellenism.
In &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, Syria, and Egypt they found themselves on its native
soil, which yielded, we may be sure, a plentiful harvest of ideas&mdash;Neo-platonic,
Gnostical, Christian, mystical, pantheistic, and
what not? In Mesopotamia, the heart of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Empire,
dwelt a strange people, who were really Syrian heathens, but
who towards the beginning of the ninth century assumed the
name of &#7778;&aacute;bians in order to protect themselves from the persecution
with which they were threatened by the Caliph
Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n. At this time, indeed, many of them accepted
Islam or Christianity, but the majority clung to their old
pagan beliefs, while the educated class continued to profess a
religious philosophy which, as it is described by Shahrast&aacute;n&iacute; and
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_389" id="Page_389" href="#"><span><i>ORIGIN OF &#7778;&Uacute;F&Iacute; THEOSOPHY</i></span>389</a></span>
other Mu&#7717;ammadan writers, is simply the Neo-platonism of
Proclus and Iamblichus. To return to Dhu &#8217;l-N&uacute;n, it is
incredible that a mystic and natural philosopher living in the
first half of the ninth century in Egypt should have derived his
doctrine directly from India. There may be Indian elements
in Neo-platonism and Gnosticism, but this possibility does not
affect my contention that the immediate source of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;
theosophy is to be sought in Greek and Syrian speculation.
To define its origin more narrowly is not, I think, practicable
in the present state of our knowledge. Merx, however, would
trace it to Dionysius, the Pseudo-Areopagite, or rather to his
master, a certain "Hierotheus," whom Frothingham has
identified with the Syrian mystic, Stephen bar Sudaili (<i>circa</i>
500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Dionysius was of course a Christian Neo-platonist.
His works certainly laid the foundations of medi&aelig;val mysticism
in Europe, and they were also popular in the East at the time
when &#7778;&uacute;fiism arose.</p>

<p>When speaking of the various current theories as to the
origin of &#7778;&uacute;fiism, I said that in my opinion they all contained
<span class="sidenote"> &#7778;&uacute;fiism composed
of many
different
elements.</span>
a measure of truth. No single cause will account
for a phenomenon so widely spread and so diverse
in its manifestations. &#7778;&uacute;fiism has always been
thoroughly eclectic, absorbing and transmuting
whatever 'broken lights' fell across its path, and consequently
it gained adherents amongst men of the most opposite views&mdash;theists
and pantheists, Mu&#8216;tazilites and Scholastics, philosophers
and divines. We have seen what it owed to Greece, but the
Perso-Indian elements are not to be ignored. Although the
theory "that it must be regarded as the reaction of the Aryan
mind against a Semitic religion imposed on it by force"
is inadmissible&mdash;Dhu &#8217;l-N&uacute;n, for example, was a Copt or
Nubian&mdash;the fact remains that there was at the time a powerful
anti-Semitic reaction, which expressed itself, more or less
consciously, in &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of Persian race. Again, the literary influence
of India upon Mu&#7717;ammadan thought before 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_390" id="Page_390" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>390</a></span>
was greatly inferior to that of Greece, as any one can see
by turning over the pages of the <i>Fihrist</i>; but Indian religious
ideas must have penetrated into Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n and Eastern Persia
at a much earlier period.</p>

<p>These considerations show that the question as to the origin
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism cannot be answered in a definite and exclusive way.
None of the rival theories is completely true, nor is any of
them without a partial justification. The following words of
Dr. Goldziher should be borne in mind by all who are
interested in this subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"&#7778;&uacute;fiism cannot be looked upon as a regularly organised sect within
Islam. Its dogmas cannot be compiled into a regular system. It
<span class="sidenote"> Goldziher on the
character of
&#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
manifests itself in different shapes in different
countries. We find divergent tendencies, according
to the spirit of the teaching of distinguished theosophists
who were founders of different schools, the followers of
which may be compared to Christian monastic orders. The influence
of different environments naturally affected the development
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism. Here we find mysticism, there asceticism the prevailing
thought."<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a></p></div>

<p>The four principal foreign sources of &#7778;&uacute;fiism are undoubtedly
Christianity, Neo-platonism, Gnosticism, and Indian asceticism
and religious philosophy. I shall not attempt in this place to
estimate their comparative importance, but it should be clearly
understood that the speculative and theosophical side of &#7778;&uacute;fiism,
which, as we have seen, was first elaborated in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, Syria, and
Egypt, bears unmistakable signs of Hellenistic influence.</p>

<p class="tb">The early &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s are particularly interested in the theory of
mystical union (<i>fan&aacute; wa-baq&aacute;</i>) and often use expressions which
it is easy to associate with pantheism, yet none of them can fairly
be called a pantheist in the true sense. The step from theosophy

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_391" id="Page_391" href="#"><span><i>B&Aacute;YAZ&Iacute;D OF BIS&#7788;&Aacute;M</i></span>391</a></span>

to pantheism was not, I think, made either by &#7716;all&aacute;j (&#8224;&nbsp;922 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
or by the celebrated Ab&uacute; Yaz&iacute;d, in Persian B&aacute;yaz&iacute;d (&#8224;&nbsp;874-75
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), of Bis&#7789;&aacute;m, a town in the province of Q&uacute;mis situated
near the south-eastern corner of the Caspian Sea. <span class="sidenote"> B&aacute;yaz&iacute;d of
Bis&#7789;&aacute;m.</span>
While his father, Sur&uacute;sh&aacute;n, was a Zoroastrian,
his master in &#7778;&uacute;fiism seems to have been connected
with Sind (Scinde), where Moslem governors had been installed
since 715 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> B&aacute;yaz&iacute;d carried the experimental doctrine of
<i>fan&aacute;</i> (dying to self) to its utmost limit, and his language is
tinged with the peculiar poetic imagery which was afterwards
developed by the great &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, Ab&uacute; Sa&#8216;&iacute;d b. Abi
&#8217;l-Khayr (&#8224;&nbsp;1049 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). I can give only a few specimens of
his sayings. Their genuineness is not above suspicion, but they
serve to show that if the theosophical basis of &#7778;&uacute;fiism is distinctively
Greek, its mystical extravagances are no less distinctively
Oriental.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Creatures are subject to 'states' (<i>a&#7717;w&aacute;l</i>), but the gnostic has no
'state,' because his vestiges are effaced and his essence is annihilated
by the essence of another, and his traces are lost in another's traces.</p>

<p>"I went from God to God until they cried from me in me, 'O
Thou I!'</p>

<p>"Nothing is better for Man than to be without aught, having no
asceticism, no theory, no practice. When he is without all, he is
with all.</p>

<p>"Verily I am God, there is no God except me, so worship me!</p>

<p>"Glory to me! how great is my majesty!</p>

<p>"I came forth from B&aacute;yaz&iacute;d-ness as a snake from its skin. Then
I looked. I saw that lover, beloved, and love are one, for in the
world of unification all can be one.</p>

<p>"I am the wine-drinker and the wine and the cup-bearer."</p></div>

<p>Thus, in the course of a century, &#7778;&uacute;fiism, which at first
was little more than asceticism, became in succession mystical
and theosophical, and even ran the risk of being confused with
pantheism. Henceforward the term <i>Ta&#7779;awwuf</i> unites all these
varying shades. As a rule, however, the great &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of the
third century <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> (815-912 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) keep their antinomian
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_392" id="Page_392" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>392</a></span>
enthusiasm under control. Most of them agreed with Junayd
of Baghd&aacute;d (&#8224;&nbsp;909 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the leading theosophist of his time,
in preferring "the path of sobriety," and in seeking to reconcile
the Law (<i>shar&iacute;&#8216;at</i>) with the Truth (<i>&#7717;aq&iacute;qat</i>). "Our
principles," said Sahl b. &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h al-Tustar&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;896 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
"are six: to hold fast by the Book of God, to model ourselves
upon the Apostle (Mu&#7717;ammad), to eat only what is lawful,
to refrain from hurting people even though they hurt us, to
avoid forbidden things, and to fulfil obligations without delay."
To these articles the strictest Moslem might cheerfully subscribe.
&#7778;&uacute;fiism in its ascetic, moral, and devotional aspects
was a spiritualised Islam, though it was a very different thing
essentially. While doing lip-service to the established religion,
it modified the dogmas of Islam in such a way as to deprive
them of their original significance. Thus Allah, the God of
mercy and wrath, was in a certain sense depersonalised and
worshipped as the One absolutely Real (<i>al-&#7716;aqq</i>). Here the
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s betray their kinship with the Mu&#8216;tazilites, but the two
sects have little in common except the Greek philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a>
It must never be forgotten that &#7778;&uacute;fiism was the expression of
a profound religious feeling&mdash;"hatred of the world and love
of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> "<i>Ta&#7779;awwuf</i>," said Junayd, "is this: that God
should make thee die to thyself and should make thee live
in Him."</p>

<p>The further development of &#7778;&uacute;fiism may be indicated in a
few words.</p>

<p>What was at first a form of religion adopted by individuals
and communicated to a small circle of companions gradually
became a monastic system, a school for saints, with rules
of discipline and devotion which the novice (<i>mur&iacute;d</i>) learned
from his spiritual director (<i>p&iacute;r</i> or <i>ust&aacute;dh</i>), to whose guidance he
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_393" id="Page_393" href="#"><span><i>DEVELOPMENT OF &#7778;&Uacute;FIISM</i></span>393</a></span>
submitted himself absolutely. Already in the third century after
Mu&#7717;ammad it is increasingly evident that the typical &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; adept
of the future will no longer be a solitary ascetic <span class="sidenote"> The development
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism.</span>
shunning the sight of men, but a great Shaykh and
hierophant, who appears on ceremonial occasions
attended by a numerous train of admiring disciples. Soon the
doctrine began to be collected and embodied in books. Some
of the most notable Arabic works of reference on &#7778;&uacute;fiism have
been mentioned already. Among the oldest are the <i>Kit&aacute;bu
&#8217;l-Luma&#8216;</i>, by Ab&uacute; Na&#7779;r al-Sarr&aacute;j (&#8224;&nbsp;988 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and the <i>Q&uacute;tu
&#8217;l-Qul&uacute;b</i> by Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib al-Makk&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;996 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The twelfth
century saw the rise of the Dervish Orders. &#8216;Ad&iacute; al-Hakk&aacute;r&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1163 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;dir al-J&iacute;l&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1166 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) founded
the fraternities which are called &#8216;Adaw&iacute;s and Q&aacute;dir&iacute;s, after
their respective heads. These were followed in rapid succession
by the Rif&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;s, the Sh&aacute;dhil&iacute;s, and the Mevlev&iacute;s, of whom
the last named owe their origin to the Persian poet and mystic,
Jal&aacute;lu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n R&uacute;m&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1273 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). By this time, mainly
through the influence of Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;, &#7778;&uacute;fiism had won for itself a
secure and recognised position in the Mu&#7717;ammadan Church.
Orthodoxy was forced to accept the popular Saint-worship and
to admit the miracles of the <i>Awliy&aacute;</i>, although many Moslem
puritans raised their voices against the superstitious veneration
which was paid to the tombs of holy men, and against the
prayers, sacrifices, and oblations offered by the pilgrims who
assembled. Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute; also gave the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; doctrine a metaphysical
basis. For this purpose he availed himself of the terminology,
which F&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute; (also a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;) and Avicenna had already borrowed
from the Neo-platonists. From his time forward we find in
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; writings constant allusions to the Plotinian theories of
emanation and ecstasy.</p>

<p class="tb">Mysticism was more congenial to the Persians than to the
Arabs, and its influence on Arabic literature is not to be
compared with the extraordinary spell which it has cast
over the Persian mind since the eleventh century of the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_394" id="Page_394" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>394</a></span>

Christian era to the present day. With few exceptions, the
great poets of Persia (and, we may add, of Turkey) speak the
allegorical language and use the fantastic imagery of which
the quatrains of the Persian &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, Ab&uacute; Sa&#8216;&iacute;d b. Abi &#8217;l-Khayr,<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a>
afford almost the first literary example. The Arabs have only
one mystical poet worthy to stand beside the Persian masters.
This is Sharafu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n &#8216;Umar Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, who <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Umar Ibnu
&#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;.</span>
was born in Cairo (1181 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and died there in
1235. His <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> was edited by his grandson
&#8216;Al&iacute;, and the following particulars regarding the poet's life
are extracted from the biographical notice prefixed to this
edition<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Shaykh &#8216;Umar Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; was of middle stature; his face
was fair and comely, with a mingling of visible redness; and
when he was under the influence of music (<i>sam&aacute;&#8216;</i>) and rapture
(<i>wajd</i>), and overcome by ecstasy, it grew in beauty and brilliancy,
and sweat dropped from his body until it ran on the
ground under his feet. I never saw (so his son relates)
among Arabs or foreigners a figure equal in beauty to his, and
I am the likest of all men to him in form.... And when he
walked in the city, the people used to press round him asking his
blessing and trying to kiss his hand, but he would not allow anyone
to do so, but put his hand in theirs.... &#8216;Umar Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; said:
'In the beginning of my detachment (<i>tajr&iacute;d</i>) from the world I used
to beg permission of my father and go up to the W&aacute;di &#8217;l-Musta&#7693;&#8216;af&iacute;n
on the second mountain of al-Muqa&#7789;&#7789;am. Thither I would resort
and continue in this hermit life (<i>s&iacute;y&aacute;&#7717;a</i>) night and day; then I would
return to my father, as bound in duty to cherish his affection. My
father was at that time Lieutenant of the High Court (<i>khal&iacute;fatu
&#8217;l-&#7717;ukmi &#8217;l-&#8216;az&iacute;z</i>) in Q&aacute;hira and Mi&#7779;r,<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> the two guarded cities, and was
one of the men most eminent for learning and affairs. He was
wont to be glad when I returned, and he frequently let me sit with
him in the chambers of the court and in the colleges of law. Then
I would long for "detachment," and beg leave to return to the life of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_395" id="Page_395" href="#"><span><i>&#8216;UMAR IBNU &#8217;L-F&Aacute;RI&#7692;</i></span>395</a></span>

a wandering devotee, and thus I was doing repeatedly, until my
father was asked to fill the office of Chief Justice (<i>Q&aacute;&#7693;i &#8217;l-Qu&#7693;&aacute;t</i>), but
refused, and laid down the post which he held, and retired from
society, and gave himself entirely to God in the preaching-hall
(<i>q&aacute;&#8216;atu &#8217;l-khi&#7789;&aacute;ba</i>) of the Mosque al-Azhar. After his death I
resumed my former detachment, and solitary devotion, and travel
in the way of Truth, but no revelation was vouchsafed to me. One
day I came to Cairo and entered the Sayfiyya College. At the gate
I found an old grocer performing an ablution which was not
prescribed. First he washed his hands, then his feet; then he wiped
his head and washed his face. "O Shaykh," I said to him, "do you,
after all these years, stand beside the gate of the college among the
Moslem divines and perform an irregular ablution?" He looked at
me and said, "O &#8216;Umar, nothing will be vouchsafed to thee in Egypt,
but only in the &#7716;ij&aacute;z, at Mecca (may God exalt it!); set out thither,
for the time of thy illumination hath come." Then I knew that the
man was one of God's saints and that he was disguising himself by
his manner of livelihood and by pretending to be ignorant of the
irregularity of the ablution. I seated myself before him and said
to him, "O my master, how far am I from Mecca! and I cannot find
convoy or companions save in the months of Pilgrimage." He looked
at me and pointed with his hand and said, "Here is Mecca in front
of thee"; and as I looked with him, I saw Mecca (may God exalt
it!); and bidding him farewell, I set off to seek it, and it was always
in front of me until I entered it. At that moment illumination came
to me and continued without any interruption.... I abode in a
valley which was distant from Mecca ten days' journey for a hard
rider, and every day and night I would come forth to pray the five
prayers in the exalted Sanctuary, and with me was a wild beast of
huge size which accompanied me in my going and returning, and
knelt to me as a camel kneels, and said, "Mount, O my master," but
I never did so.'"</p></div>

<p>When fifteen years had elapsed, &#8216;Umar Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;
returned to Cairo. The people venerated him as a saint,
and the reigning monarch, Malik al-K&aacute;mil, wished to visit
him in person, but &#8216;Umar declined to see him, and rejected his
bounty. "At most times," says the poet's son, "the Shaykh
was in a state of bewilderment, and his eyes stared fixedly.
He neither heard nor saw any one speaking to him. Now he
would stand, now sit, now repose on his side, now lie on his

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_396" id="Page_396" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>396</a></span>

back wrapped up like a dead man; and thus would he pass
ten consecutive days, more or less, neither eating nor drinking
nor speaking nor stirring." In 1231 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he made the
pilgrimage to Mecca, on which occasion he met his famous
contemporary, Shih&aacute;bu&#8217; l-D&iacute;n Ab&uacute; &#7716;af&#7779; &#8216;Umar al-Suhraward&iacute;.
He died four years later, and was buried in the Qar&aacute;fa
cemetery at the foot of Mount Muqa&#7789;&#7789;am.</p>

<p>His <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> of mystical odes, which were first collected and
published by his grandson, is small in extent compared with
<span class="sidenote">The poetry of
Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;.</span>
similar works in the Persian language, but of no
unusual brevity when regarded as the production
of an Arabian poet.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> Concerning its general
character something has been said above (p. 325). The commentator,
&#7716;asan al-B&uacute;r&iacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1615 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), praises the easy
flow (<i>insij&agrave;m</i>) of the versification, and declares that Ibnu
&#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; "is accustomed to play with ideas in ever-changing
forms, and to clothe them with splendid garments."<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> His
style, full of verbal subtleties, betrays the influence of
Mutanabb&iacute;.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> The longest piece in the <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> is a Hymn of
Divine Love, entitled <i>Na&#7827;mu &#8217;l-Sul&uacute;k</i> ('Poem on the Mystic's
Progress'), and often called <i>al-T&aacute;&#8217;iyyatu &#8217;l-Kubr&aacute;</i> ('The Greater
Ode rhyming in <i>t</i>'), which has been edited with a German
verse-translation by Hammer-Purgstall (Vienna, 1854). On
account of this poem the author was accused of favouring the
doctrine of <i>&#7717;ul&uacute;l</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the incarnation of God in human beings.
Another celebrated ode is the <i>Khamriyya</i>, or Hymn of Wine.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a>

The following versions will perhaps convey to English readers
some faint impression of the fervid rapture and almost ethereal
exaltation which give the poetry of Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; a unique
place in Arabic literature:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mu&#7717;yi &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Mu&#7717;ammad b. &#8216;Al&iacute; Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; (or Ibn
&#8216;Arab&iacute;)<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> was born at Mursiya (Murcia) in Spain on the 17th
<span class="sidenote">Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;.</span>
of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, 560 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = July 29, 1165 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
From 1173 to 1202 he resided in Seville. He
then set out for the East, travelling by way of Egypt to the
&#7716;ij&aacute;z, where he stayed a long time, and after visiting Baghd&aacute;d,
Mosul, and Asia Minor, finally settled at Damascus, in which
city he died (638 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 1240 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). His tomb below Mount
Q&aacute;siy&uacute;n was thought to be "a piece of the gardens of Paradise,"
and was called the Philosophers' Stone.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> It is now enclosed
in a mosque which bears the name of Mu&#7717;yi &#8217;l-D&iacute;n, and a
cupola rises over it.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> We know little concerning the events
of his life, which seems to have been passed chiefly in travel
and conversation with &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s and in the composition of his
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_400" id="Page_400" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>400</a></span>
voluminous writings, about three hundred in number according
to his own computation. Two of these works are
especially celebrated, and have caused Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; to be
regarded as the greatest of all Mu&#7717;ammadan mystics&mdash;the
<i>Fut&uacute;&#7717;&aacute;t al-Makkiyya</i>, or 'Meccan Revelations,' and the
<i>Fu&#7779;&uacute;&#7779;&uacute; &#8217;l-&#7716;ikam</i>, or 'Bezels of Philosophy.' The <i>Fut&uacute;&#7717;&aacute;t</i> is
a huge treatise in five hundred and sixty chapters, containing a
complete system of mystical science. The author relates that
he saw Mu&#7717;ammad in the World of Real Ideas, seated on a
throne amidst angels, prophets, and saints, and received his
command to discourse on the Divine mysteries. At another
time, while circumambulating the Ka&#8216;ba, he met a celestial
spirit wearing the form of a youth engaged in the same holy
rite, who showed him the living esoteric Temple which is
concealed under the lifeless exterior, even as the eternal
substance of the Divine Ideas is hidden by the veils of popular
religion&mdash;veils through which the lofty mind must penetrate,
until, having reached the splendour within, it partakes of the
Divine nature and beholds what no mortal eye can endure
to look upon. Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; immediately fell into a swoon.
When he came to himself he was instructed to contemplate
the visionary form and to write down the mysteries which it
would reveal to his gaze. Then the youth entered the Ka&#8216;ba
with Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;, and resuming his spiritual aspect, appeared
to him on a three-legged steed, breathed into his breast the
knowledge of all things, and once more bade him describe the
heavenly form in which all mysteries are enshrined.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> Such is
the reputed origin of the 'Meccan Revelations,' of which the
greater portion was written in the town where inspiration
descended on Mu&#7717;ammad six hundred years before. The
author believed, or pretended to believe, that every word
of them was dictated to him by supernatural means. The

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_401" id="Page_401" href="#"><span><i>MU&#7716;YI &#8217;L-D&Iacute;N IBNU &#8217;L-&#8216;ARAB&Iacute;</i></span>401</a></span>

<i>F&uacute;&#7779;&uacute;&#7779;</i>, a short work in twenty-seven chapters, each of which
is named after one of the prophets, is no less highly esteemed,
and has been the subject of numerous commentaries in Arabic,
Persian, and Turkish.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; combined the most extravagant
mysticism with the straitest orthodoxy. "He was a
&#7826;&aacute;hirite (literalist) in religion and a B&aacute;&#7789;inite (spiritualist) in his
speculative beliefs."<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> He rejected all authority (<i>taql&iacute;d</i>). "I am
not one of those who say, 'Ibn &#7716;azm said so-and-so, A&#7717;mad<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a>
said so-and-so, al-Nu&#8216;m&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> said so-and-so,'" he declares in one
of his poems. But although he insisted on punctilious adherence
to the letter of the sacred law, we may suspect that his
refusal to follow any human authority, analogy, or opinion
was simply the overweening presumption of the seer who
regards himself as divinely illuminated and infallible. Many
theologians were scandalised by the apparently blasphemous
expressions which occur in his writings, and taxed him
with holding heretical doctrines, <i>e.g.</i>, the incarnation of God
in man (<i>&#7717;ul&uacute;l</i>) and the identification of man with God
(<i>itti&#7717;&aacute;d</i>). Centuries passed, but controversy continued to
rage over him. He found numerous and enthusiastic partisans,
who urged that the utterances of the saints must not be interpreted
literally nor criticised at all. It was recognised, however,
that such high mysteries were unsuitable for the weaker
brethren, so that many even of those who firmly believed in
his sanctity discouraged the reading of his books. They were
read nevertheless, publicly and privately, from one end of the
Mu&#7717;ammadan world to the other; people copied them for the
sake of obtaining the author's blessing, and the manuscripts
were eagerly bought. Among the distinguished men who
wrote in his defence we can mention here only Majdu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n
al-F&iacute;r&uacute;z&aacute;b&aacute;d&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1414 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the author of the great Arabic
lexicon entitled <i>al-Q&aacute;m&uacute;s</i>; Jal&aacute;lu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1445 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>);
and &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Wahh&aacute;b al-Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1565 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The fundamental

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_402" id="Page_402" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>402</a></span>

principle of his system is the Unity of Being (<i>wa&#7717;datu
&#8217;l-wuj&uacute;d</i>). There is no real difference between the Essence
and its attributes or, in other words, between God and the
universe. All created things subsist eternally as ideas (<i>a&#8216;y&aacute;n
th&aacute;bita</i>) in the knowledge of God, and since being is identical
with knowledge, their "creation" only means His knowing
them, or Himself, under the aspect of actuality; the universe,
in fact, is the concrete sum of the relations of the Essence as
subject to itself as object. This pantheistic monism puts on
an Islamic mask in the doctrine of "the Perfect Man" (<i>al-Ins&aacute;n
al-K&aacute;mil</i>), a phrase which Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; was the first to
associate with it. The Divine consciousness, evolving through
a series of five planes (<i>&#7717;a&#7693;ar&aacute;t</i>), attains to complete expression
in Man, the microcosmic being who unites the creative and
creaturely attributes of the Essence and is at once <span class="sidenote"> The doctrine of
the Perfect Man.</span>
the image of God and the archetype of the universe.
Only through him does God know Himself and
make Himself known; he is the eye of the world whereby God
sees His own works. The daring paradoxes of Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;'s
dialectic are illustrated by such verses as these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
He praises me (by manifesting my perfections and creating me in His form),</span><span class="i0">
And I praise Him (by manifesting His perfections and obeying Him).</span><span class="i0">
How can He be independent when I help and aid Him? (because the Divine attributes derive the possibility of manifestation from their human correlates).</span><span class="i0">
For that cause God brought me into existence,</span><span class="i0">
And I know Him and bring Him into existence (in my knowledge and contemplation of Him).<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus it is the primary function of Man to reveal and realise
his Divine nature; and the Perfect Men, regarded individually,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_403" id="Page_403" href="#"><span><i>MU&#7716;YI &#8217;L-D&Iacute;N IBNU &#8217;L-&#8216;ARAB&Iacute;</i></span>403</a></span>

are the prophets and saints. Here the doctrine&mdash;an amalgam
of Manich&aelig;an, Gnostic, Neo-platonic and Christian speculations&mdash;attaches
itself to Mu&#7717;ammad, "the Seal of the prophets."
According to Moslem belief, the pre-existent Spirit or Light
of Mu&#7717;ammad (<i>N&uacute;r Mu&#7717;ammad&iacute;</i>) became incarnate in Adam
and in the whole series of prophets, of whom Mu&#7717;ammad is
the last. Mu&#7717;ammad, then, is the Logos,<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> the Mediator, the
Vicegerent of God (<i>Khal&iacute;fat Allah</i>), the God-Man who has
descended to this earthly sphere to make manifest the glory of
Him who brought the universe into existence.</p>

<p>But, of course, Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;'s philosophy carries him far
beyond the realm of positive religion. If God is the "self"
of all things sensible and intelligible, it follows that He reveals
Himself in every form of belief in a degree proportionate to the
pre-determined capacity of the believer; the mystic alone sees
that He is One in all forms, for the mystic's heart is all-receptive:
it assumes whatever form God reveals Himself in, as wax takes
the impression of the seal.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">
"My heart is capable of every form,</span><span class="i0">
A cloister for the monk, a fane for idols,</span><span class="i0">
A pasture for gazelles, the pilgrim's Ka&#8216;ba,</span><span class="i0">
The Tables of the Torah, the Koran.</span><span class="i0">

</div>
</div>

<p>The vast bulk of Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;'s writings, his technical and
scholastic terminology, his recondite modes of thought, and the
lack of method in his exposition have, until recently, deterred
European Orientalists from bestowing on him the attention

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_404" id="Page_404" href="#"><span><i>MYSTICISM</i></span>404</a></span>

which he deserves.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> In the history of &#7778;&uacute;fiism his name marks
an epoch: it is owing to him that what began as a profoundly
religious personal movement in Islam ends as an eclectic and
definitely pantheistic system of philosophy. The title of "The
Grand Master" (<i>al-Shaykh al-Akbar</i>), by which he is commonly
designated, bears witness to his supremacy in the world of
Moslem mysticism from the Mongol Invasion to the present
day. In Persia and Turkey his influence has been enormous,
and through his pupil, &#7778;adru &#8217;l-D&iacute;n of Q&oacute;niya, he is linked with
the greatest of all &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; poets, Jal&aacute;lu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n R&uacute;m&iacute;, the author of
the <i>Mathnaw&iacute;</i>, who died some thirty years after him. Nor
did all those who borrowed his ideas call themselves Moslems.
He inspired, amongst other medi&aelig;val Christian writers, "the
Illuminated Doctor" Raymond Lull, and probably Dante.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX</h4>

<h5>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</h5>

<p>It will be remembered that before the end of the first century
of the Hijra, in the reign of the Umayyad Caliph, Wal&iacute;d b.
&#8216;Abd al-Malik (705-715 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the Moslems under &#7788;&aacute;riq
and M&uacute;s&aacute; b. Nu&#7779;ayr, crossed the Mediterranean, and having
defeated Roderic the Goth in a great battle near Cadiz,
rapidly brought the whole of Spain into subjection. The
fate of the new province was long doubtful. The Berber
insurrection which raged in Africa (734-742 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) spread to
Spain and threatened to exterminate the handful of Arab
colonists; and no sooner was this danger past than the
victors began to rekindle the old feuds and jealousies which
they had inherited from their ancestors of Qays and Kalb.
Once more the rival factions of Syria and Yemen flew to
arms, and the land was plunged in anarchy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n b. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, a grandson of
the Caliph Hish&aacute;m, had escaped from the general massacre
<span class="sidenote">&#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n, the
Umayyad.</span>
with which the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sids celebrated their triumph
over the House of Umayya, and after five years
of wandering adventure, accompanied only by
his faithful freedman, Badr, had reached the neighbourhood
of Ceuta, where he found a precarious shelter with the
Berber tribes. Young, ambitious, and full of confidence in
his destiny, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n conceived the bold plan of
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_406" id="Page_406" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>406</a></span>
throwing himself into Spain and of winning a kingdom
with the help of the Arabs, amongst whom, as he well
knew, there were many clients of his own family. Accordingly
in 755 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he sent Badr across the sea on a secret
mission. The envoy accomplished even more than was
expected of him. To gain over the clients was easy, for
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n was their natural chief, and in the event
of his success they would share with him the prize. Their
number, however, was comparatively small. The pretender
could not hope to achieve anything unless he were supported
by one of the great parties, Syrians or Yemenites. At this
time the former, led by the feeble governor, Y&uacute;suf b.
&#8216;Abd al-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n al-Fihr&iacute;, and his cruel but capable lieutenant,
&#7778;umayl b. &#7716;&aacute;tim, held the reins of power and were pursuing
their adversaries with ruthless ferocity. The Yemenites,
therefore, hastened to range themselves on the side of &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n, not that they loved his cause, but inspired solely
by the prospect of taking a bloody vengeance upon the
Syrians. These Spanish Moslems belonged to the true
Bedouin stock!</p>

<p>A few months later &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n landed in Spain,
occupied Seville, and, routing Y&uacute;suf and &#7778;umayl under the
walls of Cordova, made himself master of the capital. On
the same evening he presided, as Governor of Spain, over
the citizens assembled for public worship in the great Mosque
(May, 756 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p>During his long reign of thirty-two years &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n
was busily employed in defending and consolidating the empire
which more than once seemed to be on the point of slipping
from his grasp. The task before him was arduous in the
extreme. On the one hand, he was confronted by the
unruly Arab aristocracy, jealous of their independence and
regarding the monarch as their common foe. Between him
and them no permanent compromise was possible, and since
they could only be kept in check by an armed force stronger

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_407" id="Page_407" href="#"><span><i>&#8216;ABDU &#8217;L-RA&#7716;M&Aacute;N THE UMAYYAD</i></span>407</a></span>

than themselves, he was compelled to rely on mercenaries,
for the most part Berbers imported from Africa. Thus, by
a fatal necessity the Moslem Empire in the West gradually
assumed that despotic and Pr&aelig;torian character which we have
learned to associate with the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Government in the
period of its decline, and the results were in the end hardly
less disastrous. The monarchy had also to reckon with the
fanaticism of its Christian subjects and with a formidable
Spanish national party eager to throw off the foreign yoke.
Extraordinary energy and tact were needed to maintain
authority over these explosive elements, and if the dynasty
founded by &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n not only survived for two
centuries and a half but gave to Spain a more splendid era
of prosperity and culture than she had ever enjoyed, the
credit is mainly due to the bold adventurer from whom even
his enemies could not withhold a tribute of admiration. One
day, it is said, the Caliph Man&#7779;&uacute;r asked his courtiers, "Who
is the Falcon of Quraysh?" They replied, "O Prince of
the Faithful, that title belongs to you who have vanquished
mighty kings and have put an end to civil war." "No," said
the Caliph, "it is not I." "Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, then, or &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Malik?" "No," said Man&#7779;&uacute;r, "the Falcon of Quraysh is
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n b. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, he who traversed alone the
deserts of Asia and Africa, and without an army to aid him
sought his fortune in an unknown country beyond the sea.
With no weapons except judgment and resolution he subdued
his enemies, crushed the rebels, secured his frontiers, and
founded a great empire. Such a feat was never achieved
by any one before."<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a></p>

<p class="tb">Of the Moslems in Spain the Arabs formed only a small
minority, and they, moreover, showed all the indifference
towards religion and contempt for the laws of Islam
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_408" id="Page_408" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>408</a></span>
which might be expected from men imbued with Bedouin
traditions whose forbears had been devotedly attached to the
world-loving Umayyads of Damascus. It was otherwise with
the Spanish converts, the so-called 'Renegades' <span class="sidenote"> Islam in
Spain.</span>
or <i>Muwallad&uacute;n</i> (Affiliati) living as clients under
protection of the Arab nobility, and with the
Berbers. These races took their adopted religion very
seriously, in accordance with the fervid and sombre temperament
which has always distinguished them. Hence among
the mass of Spanish Moslems a rigorous orthodoxy prevailed.
The Berber, Ya&#7717;y&aacute; b. Ya&#7717;y&aacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;849 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), is a typical figure.
At the age of twenty-eight years he travelled to the <span class="sidenote"> Ya&#7717;y&aacute; b. Ya&#7717;y&aacute;.</span>
East and studied under M&aacute;lik. b. Anas, who dictated
to him his celebrated work known as the <i>Muwa&#7789;&#7789;a&#8217;</i>. Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
was one day at M&aacute;lik's lecture with a number of fellow-students,
when some one said, "Here comes the elephant!"
All of them ran out to see the animal, but Ya&#7717;y&aacute; did not stir.
"Why," said M&aacute;lik, "do you not go out and look at it?
Such animals are not to be seen in Spain." To this Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
replied, "I left my country for the purpose of seeing you
and obtaining knowledge under your guidance. I did not
come here to see the elephant." M&aacute;lik was so pleased
with this answer that he called him the most intelligent
(<i>&#8216;&aacute;qil</i>) of the people of Spain. On his return to Spain
Ya&#7717;y&aacute; exerted himself to spread the doctrines of his
master, and though he obstinately refused, on religious
grounds, to accept any public office, his influence and
reputation were such that, as Ibn &#7716;azm says, no Cadi was ever
appointed till Ya&#7717;y&aacute; had given his opinion and designated
the person whom he preferred.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> Thus the M&aacute;likite system,
based on close adherence to tradition, became the law of the
land. "The Spaniards," it is observed by a learned writer of
the tenth century, "recognise only the Koran and the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_409" id="Page_409" href="#"><span><i>BIGOTRY OF THE MOSLEM CLERGY</i></span>409</a></span>

<i>Muwa&#7789;&#7789;a&#8217;</i>; if they find a follower of Ab&uacute; &#7716;an&iacute;fa or Sh&aacute;fi&#8216;&iacute;,
they banish him from Spain, and if they meet with a
Mu&#8216;tazilite or a Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite or any one of that sort, they often put
him to death."<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> Arrogant, intensely bigoted, and ambitious
of power, the Mu&#7717;ammadan clergy were not disposed to play
a subordinate r&ocirc;le in the State. In Hish&aacute;m (788-796 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
the successor of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n, they had a prince after their
own heart, whose piety and devotion to their interests left
nothing to be desired. &#7716;akam (796-822 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) was less complaisant.
He honoured and respected the clergy, but at the
same time he let them see that he would not permit them to
interfere in political affairs. The malcontents, headed by the
fiery Ya&#7717;y&aacute; b. Ya&#7717;y&aacute;, replied with menaces and insults, and
called on the populace of Cordova&mdash;especially the 'Renegades'
in the southern quarter (<i>raba&#7693;</i>) of the city&mdash;to rise against
the tyrant and his insolent soldiery. One day in Rama&#7693;&aacute;n,
198 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> (May, 814 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), &#7716;akam suddenly found himself cut
off from the garrison and besieged in his palace by an infuriated
mob, but he did not lose courage, and, thanks to his coolness
and skilful strategy, he came safely out of the <span class="sidenote"> The Revolt of
the Suburb.</span>
peril in which he stood. The revolutionary
suburb was burned to the ground and those
of its inhabitants who escaped massacre, some 60,000 souls,
were driven into exile. The real culprits went unpunished.
&#7716;akam could not afford further to exasperate the divines, who
on their part began to perceive that they might obtain from
the prince by favour what they had failed to wring from him
by force. Being mostly Arabs or Berbers, they had a strong
claim to his consideration. Their power was soon restored,
and in the reign of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n II (822-852 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
Ya&#7717;y&aacute; himself, the ringleader of the mutiny, directed
ecclesiastical policy and dispensed judicial patronage as he
pleased.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_410" id="Page_410" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>410</a></span>

The Revolt of the Suburb was only an episode in the long
and sanguinary struggle between the Spaniards, Moslem or
Christian, on the one hand, and the monarchy of Cordova on
the other&mdash;a struggle complicated by the rival Arab tribes,
which sometimes patched up their own feuds in order to
defend themselves against the Spanish patriots, but never in
any circumstances gave their support to the detested Umayyad
Government. The hero of this war of independence <span class="sidenote">&#8216;Umar b. &#7716;af&#7779;&uacute;n.</span>
was &#8216;Umar b. &#7716;af&#7779;&uacute;n. He belonged to
a noble family of West-Gothic origin which had
gone over to Islam and settled in the mountainous district
north-east of Malaga. Hot-blooded, quarrelsome, and ready
to stab on the slightest provocation, the young man soon fell
into trouble. At first he took shelter in the wild fastnesses
of Ronda, where he lived as a brigand until he was captured
by the police. He then crossed the sea to Africa, but in
a short time returned to his old haunts and put himself at
the head of a band of robbers. Here he held out for two
years, when, having been obliged to surrender, he accepted the
proposal of the Sultan of Cordova that he and his companions
should enlist in the Imperial army. But &#8216;Umar was
destined for greater glory than the Sultan could confer upon
him. A few contemptuous words from a superior officer
touched his pride to the quick, so one fine day he galloped
off with all his men in the direction of Ronda. They found
an almost impregnable retreat in the castle of Bobastro, which
had once been a Roman fortress. From this moment, says
Dozy, &#8216;Umar b. &#7716;af&#7779;&uacute;n was no longer a brigand-chief, but
leader of the whole Spanish race in the south. The lawless
and petulant free-lance was transformed into a high-minded
patriot, celebrated for the stern justice with which he punished
the least act of violence, adored by his soldiers, and regarded
by his countrymen as the champion of the national cause.
During the rest of his life (884-917 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) he conducted the
guerilla with untiring energy and made himself a terror to the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_411" id="Page_411" href="#"><span><i>ABDU &#8217;L-RA&#7716;M&Aacute;N III</i></span>411</a></span>

Arabs, but fortune deserted him at the last, and he died&mdash;<i>felix
opportunitate mortis</i>&mdash;only a few years before complete ruin
overtook his party. The Moslem Spaniards, whose enthusiasm
had been sensibly weakened by their leader's conversion to
Christianity, were the more anxious to make their peace with
the Government, since they saw plainly the hopelessness of
continuing the struggle.</p>

<p>In 912 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III, the Defender of the
Faith (<i>al-N&aacute;&#7779;ir li-d&iacute;n&iacute; &#8217;ll&aacute;h</i>), succeeded his grandfather, the
Am&iacute;r &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h, on the throne of Cordova. The character,
genius, and enterprise of this great monarch are strikingly
depicted in the following passage from the pen of an eloquent
historian whose work, although it was published some fifty
years ago, will always be authoritative<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Amongst the Umayyad sovereigns who have ruled Spain the
first place belongs incontestably to &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III. What he

III
(912-961 <span class="smcap">A.D</span>).</span>
accomplished was almost miraculous. He had found
the empire abandoned to anarchy and civil war, rent
by factions, parcelled amongst a multitude of heterogeneous
princes, exposed to incessant attacks from the Christians of
the north, and on the eve of being swallowed up either by the
L&eacute;onnese or the Africans. In spite of innumerable obstacles he
had saved Spain both from herself and from the foreign domination.
He had endowed her with new life and made her greater and
stronger than she had ever been. He had given her order and
prosperity at home, consideration and respect abroad. The public
treasury, which he had found in a deplorable condition, was now
overflowing. Of the Imperial revenues, which amounted annually
to 6,245,000 pieces of gold, a third sufficed for ordinary expenses;
a third was held in reserve, and &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n devoted the
remainder to his buildings. It was calculated that in the year 951
he had in his coffers the enormous sum of 20,000,000 pieces of gold,
so that a traveller not without judgment in matters of finance
assures us that &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n and the &#7716;amd&aacute;nid (N&aacute;&#7779;iru
&#8217;l-Dawla), who was then reigning over Mesopotamia, were the
wealthiest princes of that epoch. The state of the country was in

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_412" id="Page_412" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>412</a></span>

keeping with the prosperous condition of the treasury. Agriculture,
industry, commerce, the arts and the sciences, all flourished....
Cordova, with its half-million inhabitants, its three thousand mosques,
its superb palaces, its hundred and thirteen thousand houses, its
three hundred bagnios, and its twenty-eight suburbs, was inferior in
extent and splendour only to Baghd&aacute;d, with which city the Cordovans
loved to compare it.... The power of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n was
formidable. A magnificent fleet enabled him to dispute with the
F&aacute;&#7789;imids the empire of the Mediterranean, and secured him in the
possession of Ceuta, the key of Mauritania. A numerous and well-disciplined
army, perhaps the finest in the world, gave him superiority
over the Christians of the north. The proudest sovereigns
solicited his alliance. The emperor of Constantinople, the kings of
Germany, Italy, and France sent ambassadors to him.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, these were brilliant results; but what excites our
astonishment and admiration when we study this glorious reign is
not so much the work as the workman: it is the might of that comprehensive
intelligence which nothing escaped, and which showed
itself no less admirable in the minutest details than in the loftiest
conceptions. This subtle and sagacious man, who centralises, who
founds the unity of the nation and of the monarchy, who by means
of his alliances establishes a sort of political equilibrium, who in his
large tolerance calls the professors of another religion into his
councils, is a modern king rather than a medi&aelig;val Caliph."<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a></p></div>

<p>In short, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III made the Spanish Moslems
one people, and formed out of Arabs and Spaniards a united
Andalusian nation, which, as we shall presently see, advanced
with incredible swiftness to a height of culture that was the
envy of Europe and was not exceeded by any contemporary
State in the Mu&#7717;ammadan East. With his death, however, the
decline of the Umayyad dynasty began. His son, &#7716;akam II
(&#8224;&nbsp;976 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), left as heir-apparent a boy eleven years old,
Hish&aacute;m II, who received the title of Caliph while the government
was carried on by his mother Aurora and <span class="sidenote">Regency of
Man&#7779;&uacute;r Ibn Ab&iacute;
&#8216;&Aacute;mir
(976-1002 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
the ambitious minister Mu&#7717;ammad b. Ab&iacute; &#8216;&Aacute;mir.
The latter was virtually monarch of Spain, and
whatever may be thought of the means by which he rose to
eminence, or of his treatment of the unfortunate Caliph whose

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_413" id="Page_413" href="#"><span><i>MAN&#7778;&Uacute;R IBN AB&Iacute; &#8216;&Aacute;MIR</i></span>413</a></span>

mental faculties he deliberately stunted and whom he condemned
to a life of monkish seclusion, it is impossible to deny
that he ruled well and nobly. He was a great statesman and
a great soldier. No one could accuse him of making an
idle boast when he named himself 'Al-Man&#7779;&uacute;r' ('The
Victorious'). Twice every year he was accustomed to lead

amidst revolution and civil war the Umayyad dynasty passed
away (1031 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</p>

<p class="tb">It has been said with truth that the history of Spain in the
eleventh century bears a close resemblance to that of Italy in
the fifteenth. The splendid empire of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III
was broken up, and from its ruins there emerged a fortuitous
conglomeration of petty states governed by successful
condottieri. Of these Party Kings (<i>Mul&uacute;ku <span class="sidenote">The Party Kings
(<i>Mul&uacute;ku
&#8217;l-&#7788;aw&aacute;&#8217;if</i>).</span>
&#8217;l-&#7788;aw&aacute;&#8217;if</i>), as they are called by Mu&#7717;ammadan
writers, the most powerful were the &#8216;Abb&aacute;dids of
Seville. Although it was an age of political decay, the
material prosperity of Spain had as yet suffered little diminution,
whilst in point of culture the society of this time reached
a level hitherto unequalled. Here, then, we may pause for a
moment to review the progress of literature and science
during the most fruitful period of the Moslem occupation
of European soil.</p>

<p class="tb">Whilst in Asia, as we have seen, the Arab conquerors
yielded to the spell of an ancient culture infinitely superior to
<span class="sidenote">Influence of
Arabic culture
on the
Spaniards.</span>
their own, they no sooner crossed the Straits of
Gibraltar than the r&ocirc;les were reversed. As the
invaders extended their conquests to every part of
the peninsula, thousands of Christians fell into their
hands, who generally continued to live under Moslem protection.
They were well treated by the Government, enjoyed religious
liberty, and often rose to high offices in the army or at court.
Many of them became rapidly imbued with Moslem civilisation,
so that as early as the middle of the ninth century we find
Alvaro, Bishop of Cordova, complaining that his co-religionists
read the poems and romances of the Arabs, and studied the
writings of Mu&#7717;ammadan theologians and philosophers, not in
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_415" id="Page_415" href="#"><span><i>INFLUENCE OF ARABIC CULTURE</i></span>415</a></span>
order to refute them but to learn how to express themselves in
Arabic with correctness and elegance. "Where," he asks,
"can any one meet nowadays with a layman who reads the
Latin commentaries on the Holy Scriptures? Who studies
the Gospels, the Prophets, the Apostles? Alas, all young
Christians of conspicuous talents are acquainted only with the
language and writings of the Arabs; they read and study
Arabic books with the utmost zeal, spend immense sums of
money in collecting them for their libraries, and proclaim
everywhere that this literature is admirable. On the other
hand, if you talk with them of Christian books, they reply
contemptuously that these books are not worth their notice.
Alas, the Christians have forgotten their own language, and
amongst thousands of us scarce one is to be found who can
write a tolerable Latin letter to a friend; whereas very many
are capable of expressing themselves exquisitely in Arabic and
of composing poems in that tongue with even greater skill than
the Arabs themselves."<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a></p>

<p>However the good bishop may have exaggerated, it is
evident that Mu&#7717;ammadan culture had a strong attraction
for the Spanish Christians, and equally, let us add, for the
Jews, who made numerous contributions to poetry, philosophy,
and science in their native speech as well as in the kindred
Arabic idiom. The 'Renegades,' or Spanish converts to
Islam, became completely Arabicised in the course of a few
generations; and from this class sprang some of the chief
ornaments of Spanish-Arabian literature.</p>

<p class="tb">Considered as a whole, the poetry of the Moslems in
Europe shows the same characteristics which have already
<span class="sidenote"> The poetry
of the
Spanish Arabs.</span>
been noted in the work of their Eastern contemporaries.
The paralysing conventions from which
the laureates of Baghd&aacute;d and Aleppo could not
emancipate themselves remained in full force at Cordova and
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_416" id="Page_416" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>416</a></span>
Seville. Yet, just as Arabic poetry in the East was modified
by the influences of Persian culture, in Spain also the gradual
amalgamation of Aryans with Semites introduced new
elements which have left their mark on the literature of both
races. Perhaps the most interesting features of Spanish-Arabian
poetry are the tenderly romantic feeling which not infrequently
appears in the love-songs, a feeling that sometimes
anticipates the attitude of medi&aelig;val chivalry; and in the
second place an almost modern sensibility to the beauties of
nature. On account of these characteristics the poems in
question appeal to many European readers who do not easily
enter into the spirit of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> or the odes of
Mutanabb&iacute;, and if space allowed it would be a pleasant task
to translate some of the charming lyric and descriptive pieces
which have been collected by anthologists. The omission,
however, is less grave inasmuch as Von Schack has given us a
series of excellent versions in his <i>Poesie und Kunst der Araber
in Spanien und Sicilien</i> (2nd ed., Stuttgart, 1877).</p>

<p>"One of its marvels," says Qazw&iacute;n&iacute;, referring to the town
of Shilb (Silves) in Portugal, "is the fact, which innumerable
persons have mentioned, that the people living there, with few
exceptions, are makers of verse and devoted to belles-lettres;
and if you passed by a labourer standing behind his plough
and asked him to recite some verses, he would at once
improvise on any subject that you might demand."<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> Of <span class="sidenote"> Folk-songs.</span>
such folk-songs the <i>zajal</i> and <i>muwashsha&#7717;</i> were
favourite types.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> Both forms were invented in
Spain, and their structure is very similar, consisting of several
stanzas in which the rhymes are so arranged that the master-rhyme
ending each stanza and running through the whole
poem like a refrain is continually interrupted by a various
succession of subordinate rhymes, as is shown in the following
scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of these songs and ballads were composed in the

<p>True to the traditions of their family, the Spanish
Umayyads loved poetry, music, and polite literature a great
deal better than the Koran. Even the Falcon of <span class="sidenote">Verses by &#8216;Abdu

which had been transplanted from Syria, and that one

<p>At the court of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n II (822-852 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) a
Persian musician was prime favourite. This was Ziry&aacute;b, a
<span class="sidenote"> Ziry&aacute;b the

persuaded him to quit Baghd&aacute;d and seek his fortune in Spain.
&#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n received him with open arms, gave him a
magnificent house and princely salary, and bestowed upon him
every mark of honour imaginable. The versatile and accomplished
artist wielded a vast influence. He set the fashion in
all things appertaining to taste and manners; he fixed the
toilette, sanctioned the cuisine, and prescribed what dress
should be worn in the different seasons of the year. The
kings of Spain took him as a model, and his authority was
constantly invoked and universally recognised in that country
down to the last days of Moslem rule.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> Ziry&aacute;b was only one

of many talented and learned men who came to Spain from
the East, while the list of Spanish savants who journeyed "in
quest of knowledge" (<i>f&iacute; &#7789;alabi &#8217;l-&#8216;ilm</i>) to Africa and Egypt,
to the Holy Cities of Arabia, to the great capitals of Syria and
&#8216;Ir&aacute;q, to Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, Transoxania, and in some cases even to
China, includes, as may be seen from the perusal of Maqqar&iacute;'s
fifth chapter, nearly all the eminent scholars and men of letters
whom Moslem Spain has produced. Thus a lively exchange
of ideas was continually in movement, and so little provincialism
existed that famous Andalusian poets, like Ibn
H&aacute;n&iacute; and Ibn Zayd&uacute;n, are described by admiring Eastern
critics as the Bu&#7717;tur&iacute;s and Mutanabb&iacute;s of the West.</p>

<p>The tenth century of the Christian era is a fortunate
and illustrious period in Spanish history. Under &#8216;Abdu
&#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III and his successor, &#7716;akam II, the nation,
hitherto torn asunder by civil war, bent its united energies
to the advancement of material and intellectual culture.
&#7716;akam was an enthusiastic bibliophile. He sent his agents
in every direction to purchase manuscripts, and collected
400,000 volumes in his palace, which was <span class="sidenote"> The Library of
&#7716;akam II.</span>
thronged with librarians, copyists, and bookbinders.
All these books, we are told, he had
himself read, and he annotated most of them with his own
hand. His munificence to scholars knew no bounds. He
made a present of 1,000 d&iacute;n&aacute;rs to Abu &#8217;l-Faraj of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n,
in order to secure the first copy that was published of the
great 'Book of Songs' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>), on which the author
was then engaged. Besides honouring and encouraging the
learned, &#7716;akam took measures to spread the benefits of
education amongst the poorest of his subjects. With this
view he founded twenty-seven free schools in the capital
and paid the teachers out of his private purse. Whilst in
Christian Europe the rudiments of learning were confined
to the clergy, in Spain almost every one could read and
write.</p>

"The University of Cordova was at that time one of the most

lectures were held, Ab&uacute; Bakr b. Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya, the

had representatives no less renowned. Accordingly the students

<p>Among the notable savants of this epoch we may mention
Ibn &#8216;Abdi Rabbihi (&#8224;&nbsp;940 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), laureate of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n
III and author of a well-known anthology entitled
<i>al-&#8216;Iqd al-Far&iacute;d</i>; the poet Ibn H&aacute;n&iacute; of Seville (&#8224;&nbsp;973 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
an Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l&iacute; convert who addressed blasphemous panegyrics to

Bakr al-R&aacute;z&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;937 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), whose family belonged to Rayy in
Persia, and Ibnu &#8217;l-Q&uacute;&#7789;iyya (&#8224;&nbsp;977 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), who, as his name
indicates, was the descendant of a Gothic princess; the
astronomer and mathematician Maslama b. A&#7717;mad of Madrid
(&#8224;&nbsp;1007 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>); and the great surgeon Abu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;sim al-Zahr&aacute;w&iacute;
of Cordova, who died about the same time, and who
became known to Europe by the name of Albucasis.</p>

<p class="tb">The fall of the Spanish Umayyads, which took place in the
first half of the eleventh century, left Cordova a republic and
a merely provincial town; and though she might still claim to
be regarded as the literary metropolis of Spain, her ancient
glories were overshadowed by the independent dynasties which

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_421" id="Page_421" href="#"><span><i>THE &#8216;ABB&Aacute;DIDS</i></span>421</a></span>

now begin to flourish in Seville, Almeria, Badajoz, Granada,
Toledo, Malaga, Valencia, and other cities. Of these rival
princedoms the most formidable in arms and the most brilliant
in its cultivation of the arts was, beyond question, the family
of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;dids, who reigned in Seville. The <span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Abb&aacute;dids
(1023-1091 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
foundations of their power were laid by the Cadi
Abu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;sim Mu&#7717;ammad. "He acted towards
the people with such justice and moderation as drew on him
the attention of every eye and the love of every heart," so that
the office of chief magistrate was willingly conceded to him.
In order to obtain the monarchy which he coveted, the Cadi
employed an audacious ruse. The last Umayyad Caliph,
Hish&aacute;m II, had vanished mysteriously: it was generally supposed
that, after escaping from Cordova when that city was
stormed by the Berbers (1013 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), he fled to Asia and died
unknown; but many believed that he was still alive. Twenty
years after his disappearance there suddenly arose a pretender,
named Khalaf, who gave out that he was the Caliph Hish&aacute;m.
The likeness between them was strong enough to make the
imposture plausible. At any rate, the Cadi had his own
reasons for abetting it. He called on the people, who were
deeply attached to the Umayyad dynasty, to rally round their
legitimate sovereign. Cordova and several other States recognised
the authority of this pseudo-Caliph, whom Abu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;sim
used as a catspaw. His son &#8216;Abb&aacute;d, a treacherous and bloodthirsty
tyrant, but an amateur of belles-lettres, threw off the
mask and reigned under the title of al-Mu&#8216;ta&#7693;id (1042-1069
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). He in turn was succeeded by his son, al-Mu&#8216;tamid,
whose strange and romantic history reminds one of a sentence
frequently occurring in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>: "Were it graven
with needle-gravers upon the eye-corners, it were a warner to
whoso would be warned." He is described as "the most
liberal, the most hospitable, the most munificent, and the most
powerful of all the princes who ruled in Spain. His
court was the halting-place of travellers, the rendezvous
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_422" id="Page_422" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>422</a></span>
of poets, the point to which all hopes were directed, and
the haunt of men of talent."<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> Mu&#8216;tamid himself was a
poet of rare distinction. "He left," says Ibn <span class="sidenote">Mu&#8216;tamid of
Seville
(1069-1091 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
Bass&aacute;m, "some pieces of verse beautiful as the bud
when it opens to disclose the flower; and had the
like been composed by persons who made of poetry a profession
and a merchandise, they would still have been considered
charming, admirable, and singularly original."<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a>
Numberless anecdotes are told of Mu&#8216;tamid's luxurious life
at Seville: his evening rambles along the banks of the
Guadalquivir; his parties of pleasure; his adventures when
he sallied forth in disguise, accompanied by his Vizier, the
poet Ibn &#8216;Amm&aacute;r, into the streets of the sleeping city; and
his passion for the slave-girl I&#8216;tim&aacute;d, commonly known as
Rumaykiyya, whom he loved all his life with constant
devotion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, a terrible catastrophe was approaching.
The causes which led up to it are related by Ibn
Khallik&aacute;n as follows<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At that time Alphonso VI, the son of Ferdinand, the sovereign
of Castile and king of the Spanish Franks, had become so powerful
<span class="sidenote"> The Almoravides
in Spain.</span>
that the petty Moslem princes were obliged to make
peace with him and pay him tribute. Mu&#8216;tamid Ibn
&#8216;Abb&aacute;d surpassed all the rest in greatness of power
and extent of empire, yet he also paid tribute to Alphonso. After
capturing Toledo (May 29, 1085 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) the Christian monarch sent
him a threatening message with the demand that he should surrender
his fortresses; on which condition he might retain the open
country as his own. These words provoked Mu&#8216;tamid to such a
degree that he struck the ambassador and put to death all those
who accompanied him.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> Alphonso, who was marching on Cordova,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_423" id="Page_423" href="#"><span><i>MU&#8216;TAMID OF SEVILLE</i></span>423</a></span>

no sooner received intelligence of this event than he returned to
Toledo in order to provide machines for the siege of Seville. When
the Shaykhs and doctors of Islam were informed of this project
they assembled and said: 'Behold how the Moslem cities fall into
the hands of the Franks whilst our sovereigns are engaged in warfare
against each other! If things continue in this state the Franks
will subdue the entire country.' They then went to the Cadi (of
Cordova), &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Mu&#7717;ammad b. Adham, and conferred with
him on the disasters which had befallen the Moslems and on the
means by which they might be remedied. Every person had something
to say, but it was finally resolved that they should write to
Ab&uacute; Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b Y&uacute;suf b. T&aacute;shif&iacute;n, the king of the <i>Mulaththam&uacute;n</i><a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> and
sovereign of Morocco, imploring his assistance. The Cadi then
waited on Mu&#8216;tamid, and informed him of what had passed.
Mu&#8216;tamid concurred with them on the expediency of such an
application, and told the Cadi to bear the message himself to
Y&uacute;suf b. T&aacute;shif&iacute;n. A conference took place at Ceuta. Y&uacute;suf
recalled from the city of Morocco the troops which he had left
there, and when all were mustered he sent them across to Spain,
and followed with a body of 10,000 men. Mu&#8216;tamid, who had also
assembled an army, went to meet him; and the Moslems, on
hearing the news, hastened from every province for the purpose of
combating the infidels. Alphonso, who was then at Toledo, took
the field with 40,000 horse, exclusive of other troops which came to
join him. He wrote a long and threatening letter to Y&uacute;suf b.
T&aacute;shif&iacute;n, who inscribed on the back of it these words: '<i>What will
happen thou shalt see!</i>' and returned it. On reading the answer
Alphonso was filled with apprehension, and observed that this was a
man of resolution. The two armies met at Zall&aacute;qa, <span class="sidenote">Battle of Zall&aacute;qa
(October 23,
1086 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
near Badajoz. The Moslems gained the victory, and
Alphonso fled with a few others, after witnessing the
complete destruction of his army. This year was
adopted in Spain as the commencement of a new era, and was

<p>Mu&#8216;tamid soon perceived that he had "dug his own grave"&mdash;to
quote the words used by himself a few years afterwards&mdash;when
he sought aid from the perfidious Almoravide. Y&uacute;suf
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_424" id="Page_424" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>424</a></span>
could not but contrast the beauty, riches, and magnificent
resources of Spain with the barren deserts and rude civilisation
of Africa. He was not content to admire at a distance the
enchanting view which had been dangled before him. In
the following year he returned to Spain and took possession
of Granada. He next proceeded to pick a quarrel with
Mu&#8216;tamid. The Berber army laid siege to Seville, and
although Mu&#8216;tamid displayed the utmost bravery, he was
unable to prevent the fall of his capital (September,
1091 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The unfortunate prince was <span class="sidenote">Captivity and
death of
Mu&#8216;tamid.</span>
thrown into chains and transported to Morocco.
Y&uacute;suf spared his life, but kept him a prisoner at Aghm&aacute;t,
where he died in 1095 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> During his captivity he
bewailed in touching poems the misery of his state, the
sufferings which he and his family had to endure, and the
tragic doom which suddenly deprived him of friends, fortune,
and power. "Every one loves Mu&#8216;tamid," wrote an historian
of the thirteenth century, "every one pities him, and even now
he is lamented."<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> He deserved no less, for, as Dozy remarks,
he was "the last Spanish-born king (<i>le dernier roi indig&egrave;ne</i>),
who represented worthily, nay, brilliantly, a nationality and
culture which succumbed, or barely survived, under the
dominion of barbarian invaders."<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a></p>

<p>The Age of the Tyrants, to borrow from Greek history a
designation which well describes the character of this period,
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn Zayd&uacute;n.</span>
yields to no other in literary and scientific
renown. Poetry was cultivated at every Andalusian
court. If Seville could point with just pride to
Mu&#8216;tamid and his Vizier, Ibn &#8216;Amm&aacute;r, Cordova claimed a
second pair almost equally illustrious&mdash;Ibn Zayd&uacute;n (1003-1071
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and Wall&aacute;da, a daughter of the Umayyad Caliph
al-Mustakf&iacute;. Ibn Zayd&uacute;n entered upon a political career
and became the confidential agent of Ibn Jahwar, the chief

magistrate of Cordova, but he fell into disgrace, probably on
account of his love for the beautiful and talented princess,
who inspired those tender melodies which have caused the
poet's European biographers to link his name with Tibullus
and Petrarch. In the hope of seeing her, although he durst
not show himself openly, he lingered in al-Zahr&aacute;, the royal
suburb of Cordova built by &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III. At last,
after many wanderings, he found a home at Seville, where he
was cordially received by Mu&#8216;ta&#7693;id, who treated him as an
intimate friend and bestowed on him the title of <i>Dhu
&#8217;l-Wiz&aacute;ratayn</i>.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> The following verses, which he addressed

<p>The greatest scholar and the most original genius of
Moslem Spain is Ab&uacute; Mu&#7717;ammad &#8216;Al&iacute; Ibn &#7716;azm, who
<span class="sidenote">Ibn &#7716;azm
(994-1064 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
was born at Cordova in 994 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> He came
of a 'Renegade' family, but he was so far from
honouring his Christian ancestors that he pretended
to trace his descent to a Persian freedman of Yaz&iacute;d b. Ab&iacute;
Sufy&aacute;n, a brother of the first Umayyad Caliph, Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya;
and his contempt for Christianity was in proportion to his
fanatical zeal on behalf of Islam. His father, A&#7717;mad, had
filled the office of Vizier under Man&#7779;&uacute;r Ibn Ab&iacute; &#8216;&Aacute;mir, and
Ibn &#7716;azm himself plunged ardently into politics as a client&mdash;through
his false pedigree&mdash;of the Umayyad House, to which
he was devotedly attached. Before the age of thirty he
became prime minister of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n V (1023-1024
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), but on the fall of the Umayyad Government
he retired from public life and gave himself wholly to literature.
Ibn Bashkuw&aacute;l, author of a well-known biographical
dictionary of Spanish celebrities entitled <i>al-&#7778;ila f&iacute; akhb&aacute;ri
a&#8217;immati &#8217;l-Andalus</i>, speaks of him in these terms: "Of all
the natives of Spain Ibn &#7716;azm was the most eminent by
the universality and the depth of his learning in the sciences
cultivated by the Moslems; add to this his profound
acquaintance with the Arabic tongue, and his vast abilities
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_427" id="Page_427" href="#"><span><i>IBN &#7716;AZM</i></span>427</a></span>
as an elegant writer, a poet, a biographer, and an historian;
his son possessed about 400 volumes, containing nearly 80,000
leaves, which Ibn &#7716;azm had composed and written out."<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a>
It is recorded that he said, "My only desire in seeking
knowledge was to attain a high scientific rank in this world
and the next."<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> He got little encouragement from his contemporaries.
The mere fact that he belonged to the
&#7826;&aacute;hirite school of theology would not have mattered, but
the caustic style in which he attacked the most venerable
religious authorities of Islam aroused such bitter hostility that
he was virtually excommunicated by the orthodox divines.
People were warned against having anything to do with
him, and at Seville his writings were solemnly committed
to the flames. On this occasion he is said to have
remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>After being expelled from several provinces of Spain, Ibn
&#7716;azm withdrew to a village, of which he was the owner, and
remained there until his death. Of his numerous <span class="sidenote"> 'The Book of
Religions and
Sects.'</span>
writings only a few have escaped destruction, but
fortunately we possess the most valuable of them
all, the 'Book of Religions and Sects' (<i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Milal
wa-&#8217;l-Ni&#7717;al</i>),<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> which was recently printed in Cairo for the
first time. This work treats in controversial fashion (1) of
the non-Mu&#7717;ammadan religious systems, especially Judaism,
Christianity, and Zoroastrianism, and (2) of Islam and its
dogmas, which are of course regarded from the &#7826;&aacute;hirite

standpoint, and of the four principal Mu&#7717;ammadan sects, viz.,
the Mu&#8216;tazilites, the Murjites, the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, and the Kh&aacute;rijites.
The author maintains that these sects owed their rise
to the Persians, who sought thus to revenge themselves
upon victorious Islam.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a></p>

<p class="tb">The following are some of the most distinguished Spanish
writers of this epoch: the historian, Ab&uacute; Marw&aacute;n Ibn &#7716;ayy&aacute;n
<span class="sidenote"> Literature in
Spain in
the eleventh

of Cordova (&#8224;&nbsp;1075 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), whose chief works are a
colossal history of Spain in sixty volumes entitled
<i>al-Mat&iacute;n</i> and a smaller chronicle (<i>al-Muqtabis</i>),
both of which appear to have been almost entirely
lost;<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> the jurisconsult and poet, Abu &#8217;l-Wal&iacute;d al-B&aacute;j&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1081 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>); the traditionist Y&uacute;suf Ibn &#8216;Abd al-Barr
(&#8224;&nbsp;1071 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>); and the geographer al-Bakr&iacute;, a native of
Cordova, where he died in 1094 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Finally, mention
should be made of the famous Jews, Solomon Ibn Gabirol
(Avicebron) and Samuel Ha-Levi. The former, who was
born at Malaga about 1020 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, wrote two philosophical
works in Arabic, and his <i>Fons Vitae</i> played an important
part in the development of medi&aelig;val scholasticism. Samuel
Ha-Levi was Vizier to B&aacute;d&iacute;s, the sovereign of <span class="sidenote"> Samuel Ha-Levi.</span>
Granada (1038-1073 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). In their admiration
of his extraordinary accomplishments the Arabs all but
forgot that he was a Jew and a prince (<i>Nagh&iacute;d</i>) in Israel.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a>
Samuel, on his part, when he wrote letters of State, did not
scruple to employ the usual Mu&#7717;ammadan formulas, "Praise
to Allah!" "May Allah bless our Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad!"
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_429" id="Page_429" href="#"><span><i>WRITERS OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY</i></span>429</a></span>
and to glorify Islam quite in the manner of a good Moslem.
He had a perfect mastery of Hebrew and Arabic; he knew
five other languages, and was profoundly versed in the
sciences of the ancients, particularly in astronomy. With
all his learning he was a supple diplomat and a man of the
world. Yet he always preserved a dignified and unassuming
demeanour, although in his days (according to Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Idh&aacute;r&iacute;)
"the Jews made themselves powerful and behaved arrogantly
towards the Moslems."<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a></p>

<p class="tb">During the whole of the twelfth, and well into the first
half of the thirteenth, century Spain was ruled by two
African dynasties, the Almoravides and the Almohades,
which originated, as their names denote, in the religious
fanaticism of the Berber tribes of the Sahara. The rise
of the Almoravides is related by Ibnu &#8217;l-Ath&iacute;r as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In this year (448 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 1056 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) was the beginning of the
power of the <i>Mulaththam&uacute;n</i>.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> These were a number of tribes
<span class="sidenote"> Rise of the
Almoravides.</span>
descended from &#7716;imyar, of which the most considerable
were Lamt&uacute;na, Jad&aacute;la, and Lam&#7789;a.... Now in
the above-mentioned year a man of Jad&aacute;la, named
Jawhar, set out for Africa<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> on his way to the Pilgrimage, for he
loved religion and the people thereof. At Qayraw&aacute;n he fell in
with a certain divine&mdash;Ab&uacute; &#8216;Imr&aacute;n al-F&aacute;s&iacute;, as is generally supposed&mdash;and
a company of persons who were studying theology
under him. Jawhar was much pleased with what he saw of their
piety, and on his return from Mecca he begged Ab&uacute; &#8216;Imr&aacute;n to
send back with him to the desert a teacher who should instruct
the ignorant Berbers in the laws of Islam. So Ab&uacute; &#8216;Imr&aacute;n sent

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_430" id="Page_430" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>430</a></span>

with him a man called &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Y&aacute;s&iacute;n al-Kuz&uacute;l&iacute;, who was an
excellent divine, and they journeyed together until they came to
the tribe of Lamt&uacute;na. Then Jawhar dismounted from his camel
and took hold of the bridle of &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h b. Y&aacute;s&iacute;n's camel, in
reverence for the law of Islam; and the men of Lamt&uacute;na
approached Jawhar and greeted him and questioned him concerning
his companion. 'This man,' he replied, 'is the bearer
of the Sunna of the Apostle of God: he has come to teach you
what is necessary in the religion of Islam.' So they bade them
both welcome, and said to &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h, 'Tell us the law of Islam,'
and he explained it to them. They answered, 'As to what you
have told us of prayer and alms-giving, that is easy; but when you
say, "He that kills shall be killed, and he that steals shall have his
hand cut off, and he that commits adultery shall be flogged or
stoned," that is an ordinance which we will not lay upon ourselves.
Begone elsewhere!'... And they came to Jad&aacute;la,
Jawhar's own tribe, and &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h called on them and the neighbouring
tribes to fulfil the law, and some consented while others
refused. Then, after a time, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h said to his followers, 'Ye
must fight the enemies of the Truth, so appoint a commander over
you.' Jawhar answered, 'Thou art our commander,' but &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h
declared that he was only a missionary, and on his advice the
command was offered to Ab&uacute; Bakr b. &#8216;Umar, the chief of Lamt&uacute;na,
a man of great authority and influence. Having prevailed upon
him to act as leader, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h began to preach a holy war, and
gave his adherents the name of Almoravides (<i>al-Mur&aacute;bit&uacute;n</i>)."<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></p></div>

<p>The little community rapidly increased in numbers and
power. Y&uacute;suf b. T&aacute;shif&iacute;n, who succeeded to the command
<span class="sidenote">The Almoravide
Empire
(1056-1147 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
in 1069 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, founded the city of Morocco, and
from this centre made new conquests in every
direction, so that ere long the Almoravides ruled
over the whole of North-West Africa from Senegal to
Algeria. We have already seen how Y&uacute;suf was invited by
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_431" id="Page_431" href="#"><span><i>THE ALMORAVIDES</i></span>431</a></span>
the &#8216;Abb&aacute;dids to lead an army into Spain, how he defeated
Alphonso VI at Zall&aacute;qa and, returning a few years later,
this time not as an ally but as a conqueror, took possession of
Granada and Seville. The rest of Moslem Spain was subdued
without much trouble: laity and clergy alike hailed in the
Berber monarch a zealous reformer of the Faith and a mighty
bulwark against its Christian enemies. The hopeful prospect
was not realised. Spanish civilisation enervated the Berbers,
but did not refine them. Under the narrow bigotry of Y&uacute;suf
and his successors free thought became impossible, culture and
science faded away. Meanwhile the country was afflicted by
famine, brigandage, and all the disorders of a feeble and corrupt
administration.</p>

<p class="tb">The empire of the Almoravides passed into the hands of
another African dynasty, the Almohades.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> Their founder,
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn T&uacute;mart.</span>
Mu&#7717;ammad Ibn T&uacute;mart, was a native of the mountainous
district of S&uacute;s which lies to the south-west
of Morocco. When a youth he made the Pilgrimage to
Mecca (about 1108 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and also visited Baghd&aacute;d, where he
studied in the Ni&#7827;&aacute;miyya College and is said to have met
the celebrated Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute;. He returned home with his head
full of theology and ambitious schemes. We need not dwell
upon his career from this point until he finally proclaimed
himself as the Mahd&iacute; (1121 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), nor describe the familiar
methods&mdash;some of them disreputable enough&mdash;by which he
induced the Berbers to believe in him. His doctrines, however,
may be briefly stated. "In most questions," says one
of his biographers,<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> "he followed the system of Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan
al-Ash&#8216;ar&iacute;, but he agreed with the Mu&#8216;tazilites in their denial
of the Divine Attributes and in a few matters besides; and he
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_432" id="Page_432" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>432</a></span>
was at heart somewhat inclined to Sh&iacute;&#8216;ism, although he gave it
no countenance in public."<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> The gist of his teaching is indicated
by the name <i>Muwa&#7717;&#7717;id</i> (Unitarian), which he bestowed
on himself, and which his successors adopted as their dynastic
title.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> Ibn T&uacute;mart emphasised the Unity of God; in other
words, he denounced the anthropomorphic ideas which prevailed
in Western Islam and strove to replace them by a
purely spiritual conception of the Deity. To this main
doctrine he added a second, that of the Infallible Im&aacute;m
(<i>al-Im&aacute;m al-Ma&#8216;&#7779;&uacute;m</i>), and he naturally asserted that the
Im&aacute;m was Mu&#7717;ammad Ibn T&uacute;mart, a descendant of &#8216;Al&iacute;
b. Ab&iacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib.</p>

<p class="tb">On the death of the Mahd&iacute; (1130 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) the supreme
command devolved upon his trusted lieutenant, &#8216;Abdu
<span class="sidenote">The Almohades
(1130-1269 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
&#8217;l-Mu&#8217;min, who carried on the holy war against
the Almoravides with growing success, until in
1158 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he "united the whole coast from the
frontier of Egypt to the Atlantic, together with Moorish
Spain, under his sceptre."<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> The new dynasty was far more
enlightened and favourable to culture than the Almoravides
had been. Y&uacute;suf, the son of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Mu&#8217;min, is described
as an excellent scholar, whose mind was stored with the
battles and traditions and history of the Arabs before and
after Islam. But he found his highest pleasure in the study
and patronage of philosophy. The great Aristotelian, Ibn
&#7788;ufayl, was his Vizier and court physician; and Ibn Rushd
(Averroes) received flattering honours both from him and
from his successor, Ya&#8216;q&uacute;b al-Man&#7779;&uacute;r, who loved to converse
with the philosopher on scientific topics, although in a fit of
orthodoxy he banished him for a time.<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> This curious mixture
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_433" id="Page_433" href="#"><span><i>THE ALMOHADES</i></span>433</a></span>
of liberality and intolerance is characteristic of the Almohades.
However they might encourage speculation in its proper place,
their law and theology were cut according to the plain &#7826;&aacute;hirite
pattern. "The Koran and the Traditions of the Prophet&mdash;or
else the sword!" is a saying of the last-mentioned sovereign,
who also revived the autos-da-f&eacute;, which had been prohibited by
his grandfather, of M&aacute;likite and other obnoxious books.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> The
spirit of the Almohades is admirably reflected in Ibn &#7788;ufayl's
famous philosophical romance, named after its hero, <i>&#7716;ayy ibn

a man, &#7716;ayy ibn Yaq&#7827;&aacute;n, who has lived alone from infancy and has
gradually, by the innate and uncorrupted powers of the mind,
developed himself to the highest philosophic level and reached the
Vision of the Divine. He has passed through all the stages of
knowledge until the universe lies clear before him, and now he
finds that his philosophy thus reached, without prophet or revelation,
and the purified religion of As&aacute;l are one and the same. The
story told by As&aacute;l of the people of the other island sitting in
darkness stirs his soul, and he goes forth to them as a missionary.
But he soon learns that the method of Mu&#7717;ammad was the true one

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_434" id="Page_434" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>434</a></span>

for the great masses, and that only by sensuous allegory and
concrete things could they be reached and held. He retires to his
island again to live the solitary life."</p></div>

<p>Of the writers who flourished under the Berber dynasties
few are sufficiently important to deserve mention in a work of
<span class="sidenote">Literature under
the Almoravides
and Almohades
(1100-1250 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
this kind. The philosophers, however, stand in
a class by themselves. Ibn B&aacute;jja (Avempace),
Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Ibn &#7788;ufayl, and M&uacute;s&aacute; b.
Maym&uacute;n (Maimonides) made their influence felt
far beyond the borders of Spain: they belong, in a sense, to
Europe. We have noticed elsewhere the great mystic,
Mu&#7717;yi &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1240 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>); his fellow-townsman,
Ibn Sab&#8216;&iacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;1269 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), a thinker of the same
type, wrote letters on philosophical subjects to Frederick II of
Hohenstaufen. Valuable works on the literary history of Spain
were composed by Ibn Kh&aacute;q&aacute;n (&#8224;&nbsp;1134 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), Ibn Bass&aacute;m
(&#8224;&nbsp;1147 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and Ibn Bashkuw&aacute;l (&#8224;&nbsp;1183 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The
geographer Idr&iacute;s&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1154 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) was born at Ceuta, studied
at Cordova, and found a patron in the Sicilian monarch,
Roger II; Ibn Jubayr published an interesting account of
his pilgrimage from Granada to Mecca and of his journey
back to Granada during the years 1183-1185 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>; Ibn
Zuhr (Avenzoar), who became a Vizier under the Almoravides,
was the first of a whole family of eminent physicians; and
Ibnu &#8217;l-Bay&#7789;&aacute;r of Malaga (&#8224;&nbsp;1248 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), after visiting Egypt,
Greece, and Asia Minor in order to extend his knowledge of
botany, compiled a Materia Medica, which he dedicated to the
Sultan of Egypt, Malik al-K&aacute;mil.</p>

forty years after this date. Amidst the general wreck one
spot remained where the Moors could find shelter. This was
Granada. Here, in 1232 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, Mu&#7717;ammad Ibnu &#8217;l-A&#7717;mar
assumed the proud title of 'Conqueror by Grace of God'

Christians at bay during two centuries and a half. <span class="sidenote">The Na&#7779;rids

That the little Moslem kingdom survived so long
was not due to its own strength, but rather to its
almost impregnable situation and to the dissensions of the
victors. The latest bloom of Arabic culture in Europe
renewed, if it did not equal, the glorious memories of
Cordova and Seville. In this period arose the world-renowned
Alhambra, <i>i.e.</i>, 'the Red Palace' (al-&#7716;amr&aacute;) of
the Na&#7779;rid kings, and many other superb monuments of which
the ruins are still visible. We must not, however, be led
away into a digression even upon such a fascinating subject
as Moorish architecture. Our information concerning literary
matters is scantier than it might have been, on account of the
vandalism practised by the Christians when they took Granada.
It is no dubious legend (like the reputed burning of the
Alexandrian Library by order of the Caliph &#8216;Umar),<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> but a well-ascertained
fact that the ruthless Archbishop Ximenez made a
bonfire of all the Arabic manuscripts on which he could lay
his hands. He wished to annihilate the record of seven
centuries of Mu&#7717;ammadan culture in a single day.</p>

<p>The names of Ibnu &#8217;l-Kha&#7789;&iacute;b and Ibn Khald&uacute;n represent
the highest literary accomplishment and historical comprehension
of which this age was capable. The latter, indeed, has
no parallel among Oriental historians.</p>

politics of his time, and his career affords a conspicuous
example of the intimate way in which Moslem poetry and
literature are connected with public life. "The Arabs did
not share the opinion widely spread nowadays, that poetical
talent flourishes best in seclusion from the tumult of the
world, or that it dims the clearness of vision which is required
for the conduct of public affairs. On the contrary, their
princes entrusted the chief offices of State to poets, and poetry
often served as a means to obtain more brilliant results than
diplomatic notes could have procured."<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> A young <span class="sidenote">Ibnu &#8217;l-Kha&#7789;&iacute;b

man like Ibnu &#8217;l-Kha&#7789;&iacute;b, who had mastered the
entire field of belles-lettres, who improvised odes
and rhyming epistles with incomparable elegance and facility,
was marked out to be the favourite of kings. He became
Vizier at the Na&#7779;rid court, a position which he held, with one
brief interval of disgrace, until 1371 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when the intrigues
of his enemies forced him to flee from Granada. He sought
refuge at Fez, and was honourably received by the reigning
Sultan, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-&#8216;Az&iacute;z; but on the accession of Abu &#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s
in 1374 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> the exiled minister was incarcerated and brought to
trial on the charge of heresy (<i>zandaqa</i>). While the inquisition
was proceeding a fanatical mob broke into the gaol and
murdered him. Maqqar&iacute; relates that Ibnu &#8217;l-Kha&#7789;ib suffered
from insomnia, and that most of his works were composed
during the night, for which reason he got the nickname of
<i>Dhu &#8217;l-&#8216;Umrayn</i>, or 'The man of two lives.'<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> He was
a prolific writer in various branches of literature, but, like so
many of his countrymen, he excelled in History. His monographs
on the sovereigns and savants of Granada (one of
which includes an autobiography) supply interesting details
concerning this obscure period.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Ibn Khald&uacute;n
(1332-1406 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></span>
present chapter, as though he were a Spaniard
either by birth or residence. He descended, it
is true, from a family, the Ban&uacute; Khald&uacute;n, which
had long been settled in Spain, first at Carmona and afterwards
at Seville; but they migrated to Africa about the
middle of the thirteenth century, and Ibn Khald&uacute;n was born
at Tunis. Nearly the whole of his life, moreover, was passed
in Africa&mdash;a circumstance due rather to accident than to
predilection; for in 1362 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he entered the service of the
Sultan of Granada, Ab&uacute; &#8216;Abdall&aacute;h Ibnu &#8217;l-A&#7717;mar, and would
probably have made that city his home had not the jealousy of
his former friend, the Vizier Ibnu &#8217;l-Kha&#7789;&iacute;b, decided him to
leave Spain behind. We cannot give any account of the
agitated and eventful career which he ended, as Cadi of
Cairo, in 1406 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Ibn Khald&uacute;n lived with statesmen and
kings: he was an ambassador to the court of Pedro of Castile,
and an honoured guest of the mighty Tamerlane. The
results of his ripe experience are marvellously displayed in
the Prolegomena (<i>Muqaddima</i>), which forms the first volume
of a huge general history entitled the <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-&#8216;Ibar</i> ('Book of
Examples').<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> He himself has stated his idea of the historian's
function in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Know that the true purpose of history is to make us acquainted
with human society, <i>i.e.</i>, with the civilisation of the world, and with
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn Khald&uacute;n as
a philosophical
historian.</span>
its natural phenomena, such as savage life, the softening
of manners, attachment to the family and the tribe, the
various kinds of superiority which one people gains
over another, the kingdoms and diverse dynasties which arise
in this way, the different trades and laborious occupations to
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_438" id="Page_438" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>438</a></span>
which men devote themselves in order to earn their livelihood,
the sciences and arts; in fine, all the manifold conditions which
naturally occur in the development of civilisation."<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a></p></div>

<p>Ibn Khald&uacute;n argues that History, thus conceived, is subject
to universal laws, and in these laws he finds the only sure
criterion of historical truth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The rule for distinguishing what is true from what is false in
history is based on its possibility or impossibility: that is to
<span class="sidenote"> His canons
of historical
criticism.</span>
say, we must examine human society (civilisation)
and discriminate between the characteristics which
are essential and inherent in its nature and those
which are accidental and need not be taken into account,
recognising further those which cannot possibly belong to it. If
we do this we have a rule for separating historical truth from error
by means of a demonstrative method that admits of no doubt....
It is a genuine touchstone whereby historians may verify whatever
they relate."<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a></p></div>

<p>Here, indeed, the writer claims too much, and it must be
allowed that he occasionally applied his principles in a pedantic
fashion, and was led by purely <i>a priori</i> considerations to conclusions
which are not always so warrantable as he believed.
This is a very trifling matter in comparison with the value
and originality of the principles themselves. Ibn Khald&uacute;n
asserts, with justice, that he has discovered a new method of
writing history. No Moslem had ever taken a view at once
so comprehensive and so philosophical; none had attempted
to trace the deeply hidden causes of events, to expose the
moral and spiritual forces at work beneath the surface, or to
divine the immutable laws of national progress and decay.
Ibn Khald&uacute;n owed little to his predecessors, although he
mentions some of them with respect. He stood far above
his age, and his own countrymen have admired rather than
followed him. His intellectual descendants are the great
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_439" id="Page_439" href="#"><span><i>IBN KHALD&Uacute;N</i></span>439</a></span>
medi&aelig;val and modern historians of Europe&mdash;Machiavelli and
Vico and Gibbon.</p>

<p class="tb">It is worth while to sketch briefly the peculiar theory of
historical development which Ibn Khald&uacute;n puts forward in
<span class="sidenote"> Ibn Kald&uacute;n's
theory of historical
evolution.</span>
his Prolegomena&mdash;a theory founded on the study
of actual conditions and events either past or
passing before his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> He was struck, in the
first place, with the physical fact that in almost every part of
the Mu&#7717;ammadan Empire great wastes of sand or stony
plateaux, arid and incapable of tillage, wedge themselves
between fertile domains of cultivated land. The former
were inhabited from time immemorial by nomad tribes, the
latter by an agricultural or industrial population; and we have
seen, in the case of Arabia, that cities like Mecca and &#7716;&iacute;ra
carried on a lively intercourse with the Bedouins and exerted
a civilising influence upon them. In Africa the same contrast
was strongly marked. It is no wonder, therefore, that Ibn
Khald&uacute;n divided the whole of mankind into two classes&mdash;Nomads
and Citizens. The nomadic life naturally precedes
and produces the other. Its characteristics are simplicity and
purity of manners, warlike spirit, and, above all, a loyal
devotion to the interests of the family and the tribe. As
the nomads become more civilised they settle down, form
states, and make conquests. They have now reached their
highest development. Corrupted by luxury, and losing the
virtues which raised them to power, they are soon swept away
by a ruder people. Such, in bare outline, is the course of
history as Ibn Khald&uacute;n regards it; but we must try to give
our readers some further account of the philosophical ideas
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_440" id="Page_440" href="#"><span><i>THE ARABS IN EUROPE</i></span>440</a></span>
underlying his conception. He discerns, in the life of tribes
and nations alike, two dominant forces which mould their
destiny. The primitive and cardinal force he calls <i>&#8216;a&#7779;abiyya</i>,
the <i>binding</i> element in society, the feeling which unites
members of the same family, tribe, nation, or empire, and
which in its widest acceptation is equivalent to the modern
term, Patriotism. It springs up and especially flourishes
among nomad peoples, where the instinct of self-preservation
awakens a keen sense of kinship and drives men to make
common cause with each other. This <i>&#8216;a&#7779;abiyya</i> is the vital
energy of States: by it they rise and grow; as it weakens
they decline; and its decay is the signal for their fall. The
second of the forces referred to is Religion. Ibn Khald&uacute;n
hardly ascribes to religion so much influence as we might
have expected from a Moslem. He recognises, however, that
it may be the only means of producing that solidarity without
which no State can exist. Thus in the twenty-seventh
chapter of his <i>Muqaddima</i> he lays down the proposition that
"the Arabs are incapable of founding an empire unless they
are imbued with religious enthusiasm by a prophet or a saint."</p>

<p>In History he sees an endless cycle of progress and
retrogression, analogous to the phenomena of human life.
Kingdoms are born, attain maturity, and die within a definite
period which rarely exceeds three generations, <i>i.e.</i>, 120 years.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a>
During this time they pass through five stages of development
and decay.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> It is noteworthy that Ibn Khald&uacute;n admits the
moral superiority of the Nomads. For him civilisation necessarily
involves corruption and degeneracy. If he did not
believe in the gradual advance of mankind towards some
higher goal, his pessimism was justified by the lessons of
experience and by the mournful plight of the Mu&#7717;ammadan
world, to which his view was restricted.<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a></p>

<h4>CHAPTER X</h4>

<h5>FROM THE MONGOL INVASION TO THE PRESENT DAY</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> proceeding to speak of the terrible catastrophe which
filled the whole of Western Asia with ruin and desolation,
<span class="sidenote"> General characteristics
of the
period.</span>
I may offer a few preliminary remarks concerning
the general character of the period which we
shall briefly survey in this final chapter. It
forms, one must admit, a melancholy conclusion to a glorious
history. The Caliphate, which symbolised the supremacy
of the Prophet's people, is swept away. Mongols, Turks,
Persians, all in turn build up great Mu&#7717;ammadan empires,
but the Arabs have lost even the shadow of a leading part and
appear only as subordinate actors on a provincial stage. The
chief centres of Arabian life, such as it is, are henceforth
Syria and Egypt, which were held by the Turkish Mamelukes
until 1517 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when they passed under Ottoman
rule. In North Africa the petty Berber dynasties (&#7716;af&#7779;ids,
Ziy&aacute;nids, and Mar&iacute;nids) gave place in the sixteenth century
to the Ottoman Turks. Only in Spain, where the Na&#7779;rids of
Granada survived until 1492 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, in Morocco, where the
Shar&iacute;fs (descendants of &#8216;Al&iacute; b. Ab&iacute; &#7788;&aacute;lib) assumed the
sovereignty in 1544 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and to some extent in Arabia
itself, did the Arabs preserve their political independence.
In such circumstances it would be vain to look for any
large developments of literature and culture worthy to rank
with those of the past. This is an age of imitation and
<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_443" id="Page_443" href="#"><span><i>CHARACTER OF THE PERIOD</i></span>443</a></span>
compilation. Learned men abound, whose erudition embraces
every subject under the sun. The mass of writing shows no
visible diminution, and much of it is valuable and meritorious
work. But with one or two conspicuous exceptions&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
the historian Ibn Khald&uacute;n and the mystic Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute;&mdash;we
cannot point to any new departure, any fruitful ideas, any
trace of original and illuminating thought. The fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries "witnessed the rise and triumph of that
wonderful movement known as the Renaissance,... but
no ripple of this great upheaval, which changed the whole
current of intellectual and moral life in the West, reached the
shores of Islam."<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> Until comparatively recent times, when
Egypt and Syria first became open to European civilisation,
the Arab retained his medi&aelig;val outlook and habit of mind,
and was in no respect more enlightened than his forefathers
who lived under the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphate. And since the
Mongol Invasion I am afraid we must say that instead of
advancing farther along the old path he was being forced back
by the inevitable pressure of events. East of the Euphrates
the Mongols did their work of destruction so thoroughly that
no seeds were left from which a flourishing civilisation could
arise; and, moreover, the Arabic language was rapidly
extinguished by the Persian. In Spain, as we have seen, the
power of the Arabs had already begun to decline; Africa
was dominated by the Berbers, a rude, unlettered race, Egypt
and Syria by the blighting military despotism of the Turks.
Nowhere in the history of this period can we discern either of
the two elements which are most productive of literary
greatness: the quickening influence of a higher culture or the
inspiration of a free and vigorous national life.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></p>

of the fourteenth the nomad tribes dwelling beyond the Oxus
<span class="sidenote"> The Mongol
Invasion.</span>
burst over Western Asia in three successive waves. First
came the Selj&uacute;q Turks, then the Mongols
under Ching&iacute;z Khan and H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;, then the
hordes, mainly Turkish, of T&iacute;m&uacute;r. Regarding
the Selj&uacute;qs all that is necessary for our purpose has been said
in a former chapter. The conquests of T&iacute;m&uacute;r are a frightful
episode which I may be pardoned for omitting from this
history, inasmuch as their permanent results (apart from the
enormous damage which they inflicted) were inconsiderable;
and although the Indian empire of the Great Moguls, which
B&aacute;bur, a descendant of T&iacute;m&uacute;r, established in the first half of
the sixteenth century, ran a prosperous and brilliant course, its
culture was borrowed almost exclusively from Persian models
and does not come within the scope of the present work.
We shall, therefore, confine our view to the second wave
of the vast Asiatic migration, which bore the Mongols, led by
Ching&iacute;z Khan and H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;, from the steppes of China and
Tartary to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="tb">In 1219 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Ching&iacute;z Khan, having consolidated his power
in the Far East, turned his face westward and suddenly

formed a province of the wide dominions of the

monarch, &#8216;Al&aacute;&#8217;u &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Mu&#7717;ammad, was unable to make an
effective resistance; and notwithstanding that his son, the

years, the invaders swarmed over Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n and Persia,
massacring the panic-stricken inhabitants wholesale and
leaving a wilderness behind them. Hitherto Baghd&aacute;d had
not been seriously threatened, but on the first day of January,
1256 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&mdash;an epoch-marking date&mdash;H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;, the grandson

al-Kham&iacute;s</i> by Diy&aacute;rbakr&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1574 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the year 654 (<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> = 1256 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) the stubborn tyrant, H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;,
the destroyer of the nations (<i>Mub&iacute;du &#8217;l-Umam</i>), set forth and took
<span class="sidenote">H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute; before

them and laid waste the lands of Rayy.... And
in the year 655 there broke out at Baghd&aacute;d a fearful
riot between the Sunn&iacute;s and the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites, which led to
great plunder and destruction of property. A number of Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites
were killed, and this so incensed and infuriated the Vizier Ibnu
&#8217;l-&#8216;Alqami that he encouraged the Tartars to invade &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, by which
means he hoped to take ample vengeance on the Sunn&iacute;s.<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> And in
the beginning of the year 656 the tyrant H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute; b. T&uacute;l&iacute; b. Ching&iacute;z
Kh&aacute;n, the Moghul, arrived at Baghd&aacute;d with his army, including the
Georgians (<i>al-Kurj</i>) and the troops of Mosul. The Daw&iacute;d&aacute;r<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a>
marched out of the city and met H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;'s vanguard, which was
commanded by B&aacute;j&uacute;.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> The Moslems, being few, suffered defeat;
whereupon B&aacute;j&uacute; advanced and pitched his camp to the west of
Baghd&aacute;d, while H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute; took up a position on the eastern side.
Then the Vizier Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Alqam&iacute; said to the Caliph Musta&#8216;&#7779;im
Bill&aacute;h: "I will go to the Supreme Kh&aacute;n to arrange peace." So the
hound<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> went and obtained security for himself, and on his return
said to the Caliph: "The Kh&aacute;n desires to marry his daughter to
your son and to render homage to you, like the Selj&uacute;q kings,
and then to depart." Musta&#8216;&#7779;im set out, attended by the nobles of

his court and the grandees of his time, in order to witness the
contract of marriage. The whole party were beheaded except the
Caliph, who was trampled to death. The Tartars <span class="sidenote"> Sack of
Baghd&aacute;d.</span>
entered Baghd&aacute;d and distributed themselves in bands
throughout the city. For thirty-four days the sword
was never sheathed. Few escaped. The slain amounted to 1,800,000
and more. Then quarter was called.... Thus it is related in
the <i>Duwalu &#8217;l-Isl&aacute;m</i>.<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a>... And on this wise did the Caliphate pass

<p>It seemed as if all Mu&#7717;ammadan Asia lay at the feet of
the pagan conqueror. Resuming his advance, H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;
occupied Mesopotamia and sacked Aleppo. He then
returned to the East, leaving his lieutenant, Ketbogh&aacute;, to
complete the reduction of Syria. Meanwhile, however, an
Egyptian army under the Mameluke Sultan Mu&#7827;affar Qu&#7789;uz
was hastening to oppose the invaders. On Friday, the 25th
of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, 658 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span>, a decisive battle was fought at &#8216;Ayn
J&aacute;l&uacute;t (Goliath's Spring), west of the Jordan. <span class="sidenote">Battle of &#8216;Ayn
J&aacute;l&uacute;t (September,
1260 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
The Tartars were routed with immense
slaughter, and their subsequent attempts to
wrest Syria from the Mamelukes met with no success. The
submission of Asia Minor was hardly more than nominal, but
in Persia the descendants of H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute;, the &Iacute;l-Kh&aacute;ns, reigned
over a great empire, which the conversion of one of their
number, Gh&aacute;z&aacute;n (1295-1304 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), restored to Moslem rule.
We are not concerned here with the further history of the
Mongols in Persia nor with that of the Persians themselves.
Since the days of H&uacute;l&aacute;g&uacute; the lands east and west of the Tigris
are separated by an ever-widening gulf. The two races&mdash;Persians
and Arabs&mdash;to whose co-operation the medi&aelig;val

world, from Samarcand to Seville, for a long time owed its
highest literary and scientific culture, have now finally dissolved
their partnership. It is true that the <span class="sidenote"> Arabic ceases to
be the language
of the whole
Moslem world.</span>
cleavage began many centuries earlier, and
before the fall of Baghd&aacute;d the Persian genius had
already expressed itself in a splendid national
literature. But from this date onward the use of Arabic
by Persians is practically limited to theological and philosophical
writings. The Persian language has driven its rival out
of the field. Accordingly Egypt and Syria will now demand
the principal share of our attention, more especially as the
history of the Arabs of Granada, which properly belongs
to this period, has been related in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p class="tb">The dynasty of the Mameluke<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> Sultans of Egypt was
founded in 1250 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> by Aybak, a Turkish slave, who
<span class="sidenote">The Mamelukes
of Egypt
(1250-1517 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
commenced his career in the service of the
Ayy&uacute;bid, Malik &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; Najmu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n. His
successors<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> held sway in Egypt and Syria
until the conquest of these countries by the Ottomans.
The Mamelukes were rough soldiers, who seldom indulged
in any useless refinement, but they had a royal taste for
architecture, as the visitor to Cairo may still see. Their
administration, though disturbed by frequent mutinies and
murders, was tolerably prosperous on the whole, and their
victories over the Mongol hosts, as well as the crushing
blows which they dealt to the Crusaders, gave Islam new
prestige. The ablest of them all was Baybars, <span class="sidenote">Sultan Baybars
(1260-1277 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
who richly deserved his title Malik al-&#7826;&aacute;hir,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Victorious King. His name has passed
into the legends of the people, and his warlike exploits into

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_448" id="Page_448" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>448</a></span>

story-tellers to this day.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> The violent and brutal acts which he
sometimes committed&mdash;for he shrank from no crime when he
suspected danger&mdash;made him a terror to the ambitious nobles
around him, but did not harm his reputation as a just ruler.
Although he held the throne in virtue of having murdered
the late monarch with his own hand, he sought to give the
appearance of legitimacy to his usurpation. He therefore
recognised as Caliph a certain Abu &#8217;l-Q&aacute;sim A&#7717;mad, a pretended
scion of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid house, invited him to Cairo, and took the
oath of allegiance to him in due form. The Caliph on his part
invested the Sultan with sovereignty over Egypt, <span class="sidenote">The &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid
Caliphs of Egypt.</span>
Syria, Arabia, and all the provinces that he might
obtain by future conquests. This A&#7717;mad, entitled
al-Mustan&#7779;ir, was the first of a long series of mock Caliphs
who were appointed by the Mameluke Sultans and generally
kept under close surveillance in the citadel of Cairo. There is
no authority for the statement, originally made by Mouradgea
d'Ohsson in 1787 and often repeated since, that the last of the
line bequeathed his rights of succession to the Ottoman Sultan
Sel&iacute;m I, thus enabling the Sultans of Turkey to claim the title
and dignity of Caliph.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a></p>

<p>The poets of this period are almost unknown in Europe, and
until they have been studied with due attention it would be
<span class="sidenote"> Arabic poetry

Invasion.</span>
premature to assert that none of them rises above
mediocrity. At the same time my own impression
(based, I confess, on a very desultory and imperfect
acquaintance with their work) is that the best among them are
merely elegant and accomplished artists, playing brilliantly with
words and phrases, but doing little else. No doubt extreme artificiality
may coexist with poetical genius of a high order, provided
that it has behind it Mutanabb&iacute;'s power, Ma&#8216;arr&iacute;'s earnestness,
or Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;'s enthusiasm. In the absence of these

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_449" id="Page_449" href="#"><span><i>POETS OF THE PERIOD</i></span>449</a></span>

qualities we must be content to admire the technical skill
with which the old tunes are varied and revived. Let us
take, for example, &#7778;afiyyu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-&#7716;ill&iacute;, who
was born at &#7716;illa, a large town on the <span class="sidenote">&#7778;afiyyu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n
al-&#7716;ill&iacute;.</span>
Euphrates, in 1278 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, became laureate of
the Urtuqid dynasty at M&aacute;rid&iacute;n, and died in Baghd&aacute;d about
1350. He is described as "the poet of his age absolutely,"
and to judge from the extracts in Kutub&iacute;'s <i>Faw&aacute;tu
&#8217;l-Wafay&aacute;t</i><a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> he combined subtlety of fancy with remarkable
ease and sweetness of versification. Many of his pieces,
however, are <i>jeux d'esprit</i>, like his ode to the Prophet, in
which he employs 151 rhetorical figures, or like another
poem where all the nouns are diminutives.<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> The following
specimen of his work is too brief to do him justice:&mdash;</p>

<p>We have already referred to the folk-songs (<i>muwashsha&#7717;</i>
and <i>zajal</i>) which originated in Spain. These simple ballads,

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_450" id="Page_450" href="#"><span><i>MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>450</a></span>

<span class="sidenote"> Popular poetry.</span>
with their novel metres and incorrect language, were despised
by the classical school, that is to say, by nearly all Moslems
with any pretensions to learning; but their
popularity was such that even the court poets
occasionally condescended to write in this style. To the
<i>zajal</i> and <i>muwashsha&#7717;</i> we may add the <i>d&uacute;bayt</i>, the <i>maw&aacute;liyy&aacute;</i>,
the <i>k&aacute;nwak&aacute;n</i>, and the <i>&#7717;im&aacute;q</i>, which together with verse
of the regular form made up the 'seven kinds of poetry'
(<i>al-fun&uacute;n al-sab&#8216;a</i>). &#7778;afiyyu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-&#7716;ill&iacute;, who wrote a
special treatise on the Arabic folk-songs, mentions two
other varieties which, he says, were invented by the people
of Baghd&aacute;d to be sung in the early dawn of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, the
Moslem Lent.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> It is interesting to observe that some few
literary men attempted, though in a timid fashion, to free
Arabic poetry from the benumbing academic system by
which it was governed and to pour fresh life into its veins.
A notable example of this tendency is the <i>Hazzu &#8217;l-Qu&#7717;&uacute;f</i><a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a>
by Shirb&iacute;n&iacute;, who wrote in 1687 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Here we have a
poem in the vulgar dialect of Egypt, but what is still more
curious, the author, while satirising the uncouth manners
and rude language of the peasantry, makes a bitter attack
on the learning and morals of the Mu&#7717;ammadan divines.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a>
For this purpose he introduces a typical Fellah named
Ab&uacute; Sh&aacute;d&uacute;f, whose r&ocirc;le corresponds to that of Piers the
Plowman in Longland's <i>Vision</i>. Down to the end of the
nineteenth century, at any rate, such isolated offshoots had not
gone far to found a living school of popular poetry. Only the
future can show whether the Arabs are capable of producing a
genius who will succeed in doing for the national folk-songs
what Burns did for the Scots ballads.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_451" id="Page_451" href="#"><span><i>IBN KHALLIK&Aacute;N</i></span>451</a></span>Biography and History were cultivated with ardour by

compositions of this kind we can have no
hesitation in awarding the place of honour to
the <i>Wafay&aacute;tu &#8217;l-A&#8216;y&aacute;n</i>, or 'Obituaries of Eminent
Men,' by Shamsu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Ibn Khallik&aacute;n, a work which
has often been quoted in the foregoing pages. The author
belonged to a distinguished family descending from Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
b. Kh&aacute;lid the Barmecide (see p. <a href="#Page_259">259</a> seq.), and was born at
Arbela in 1211 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> He received his education at Aleppo
and Damascus (1229-1238) and then proceeded to Cairo,
where he finished the first draft of his Biographical
Dictionary in 1256. Five years later he was appointed by
Sultan Baybars to be Chief Cadi of Syria. He retained
this high office (with a seven years' interval, which he
devoted to literary and biographical studies) until a short time
before his death. In the Preface to the <i>Wafay&aacute;t</i> Ibn Khallik&aacute;n
observes that he has adopted the alphabetical order as more
convenient than the chronological. As regards the scope and
character of his Dictionary, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have not limited my work to the history of any one particular
class of persons, as learned men, princes, emirs, viziers, or poets;
<span class="sidenote"> His Biographical

but I have spoken of all those whose names are
familiar to the public, and about whom questions
are frequently asked; I have, however, related the
facts I could ascertain respecting them in a concise manner, lest
my work should become too voluminous; I have fixed with all
possible exactness the dates of their birth and death; I have
traced up their genealogy as high as I could; I have marked the
orthography of those names which are liable to be written incorrectly;
and I have cited the traits which may best serve to
characterise each individual, such as noble actions, singular anecdotes,
verses and letters, so that the reader may derive amusement
from my work, and find it not exclusively of such a uniform cast
as would prove tiresome; for the most effectual inducement to
reading a book arises from the variety of its style."<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_452" id="Page_452" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>452</a></span></p>

<p>Ibn Khallikan might have added that he was the first Mu&#7717;ammadan
writer to design a Dictionary of National Biography,
since none of his predecessors had thought of comprehending
the lives of eminent Moslems of every class in a single work.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a>
The merits of the book have been fully recognised by the
author's countrymen as well as by European scholars. It is
composed in simple and elegant language, it is extremely
accurate, and it contains an astonishing quantity of miscellaneous
historical and literary information, not drily catalogued
but conveyed in the most pleasing fashion by anecdotes and
excerpts which illustrate every department of Moslem life.
I am inclined to agree with the opinion of Sir William
Jones, that it is the best general biography ever written;
and allowing for the difference of scale and scope, I
think it will bear comparison with a celebrated English
work which it resembles in many ways&mdash;I mean Boswell's

of this kind. Concerning Ibn Khald&uacute;n, who
held a professorship as well as the office of Cadi
in Cairo under Sultan Barq&uacute;q (1382-1398 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), we have
already spoken at some length. This extraordinary genius
discovered principles and methods which might have been

expected to revolutionise historical science, but neither was
he himself capable of carrying them into effect nor, as the
event proved, did they inspire his successors to abandon
the path of tradition. I cannot imagine any more decisive
symptom of the intellectual lethargy in which Islam was
now sunk, or any clearer example of the rule that even
the greatest writers struggle in vain against the spirit of
their own times. There were plenty of learned men, however,
who compiled local and universal histories. Considering
the precious materials which their industry has preserved for
us, we should rather admire these diligent and erudite authors
than complain of their inability to break away from the
established mode. Perhaps the most famous among them
is Taqiyyu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-Maqr&iacute;z&iacute; (1364-1442 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). A native
of Cairo, he devoted himself to Egyptian history and
antiquities, on which subject he composed several standard
works, such as the <i>Khi&#7789;a&#7789;</i><a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a> and the <i>Sul&uacute;k</i>.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> Although he
was both unconscientious and uncritical, too often copying

these faults which are characteristic of his age may
easily be excused. "He has accumulated and reduced to a

would but for him have passed into oblivion. He is generally
painstaking and accurate, and always resorts to contemporary

boy had already reached the <i>S&uacute;ratu &#8217;l-Ta&#7717;r&iacute;m</i> (S&uacute;ra of Forbidding),
which is the sixty-sixth chapter of the Koran, and he
knew the whole volume by heart before he was eight years old.
He prosecuted his studies under the most renowned masters
in every branch of Moslem learning, and on finishing his
education held one Professorship after another at Cairo until
1501, when he was deprived of his post in consequence of
malversation of the bursary monies in his charge. He died

four years later in the islet of Raw&#7693;a on the Nile, whither he
had retired under the pretence of devoting the rest of his life
to God. We possess the titles of more than five hundred
separate works which he composed. This number would be
incredible but for the fact that many of them are brief
pamphlets displaying the author's curious erudition on all sorts
of abstruse subjects&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, whether the Prophet wore trousers,
whether his turban had a point, and whether his parents are in
Hell or Paradise. Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute;'s indefatigable pen travelled over
an immense field of knowledge&mdash;Koran, Tradition, Law,
Philosophy and History, Philology and Rhetoric. Like some
of the old Alexandrian scholars, he seems to have taken pride
in a reputation for polygraphy, and his enemies declared that
he made free with other men's books, which he used to alter
slightly and then give out as his own. Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute;, on his part,
laid before the Shaykhu &#8217;l-Isl&aacute;m a formal accusation of
plagiarism against Qas&#7789;all&aacute;n&iacute;, an eminent contemporary divine.
We are told that his vanity and arrogance involved him in
frequent quarrels, and that he was 'cut' by his learned
brethren. Be this as it may, he saw what the public wanted.
His compendious and readable handbooks were famed
throughout the Moslem world, as he himself boasts, from
India to Morocco, and did much to popularise the scientific
culture of the day. It will be enough to mention here the
<i>Itq&aacute;n</i> on Koranic exegesis; the <i>Tafs&iacute;ru &#8217;l-Jal&aacute;layn</i>, or 'Commentary
on the Koran by the two Jal&aacute;ls,' which was begun
by Jal&aacute;lu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-Ma&#7717;all&iacute; and finished by his namesake,
Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute;; the <i>Muzhir</i> (<i>Mizhar</i>), a treatise on philology; the
<i>&#7716;usnu &#8217;l-Mu&#7717;&aacute;&#7693;ara</i>, a history of Old and New Cairo; and
the <i>Ta&#8217;r&iacute;khu &#8217;l-Khulaf&aacute;</i>, or 'History of the Caliphs.'</p>

<p class="tb">To dwell longer on the literature of this period would only
be to emphasise its scholastic and unoriginal character. A
passing mention, however, is due to the encyclop&aelig;dists Nuwayr&iacute;
(&#8224;&nbsp;1332), author of the <i>Nih&aacute;yatu &#8217;l-Arab</i>, and Ibnu &#8217;l-Ward&iacute;

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_456" id="Page_456" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>456</a></span>

(&#8224;&nbsp;1349). &#7778;afad&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1363) compiled a gigantic biographical
dictionary, the <i>W&aacute;f&iacute; bi &#8217;l-Wafay&aacute;t</i>, in twenty-six volumes, and
the learned traditionist, Ibn &#7716;ajar of Ascalon <span class="sidenote"> Other scholars
of the period.</span>
(&#8224;&nbsp;1449), has left a large number of writings,
among which it will be sufficient to name the
<i>I&#7779;&aacute;ba f&iacute; tamy&iacute;z al-&#7778;a&#7717;&aacute;ba</i>, or Lives of the Companions of the
Prophet.<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> We shall conclude this part of our subject by
enumerating a few celebrated works which may be described
in modern terms as standard text-books for the Schools and
Universities of Islam. Amidst the host of manuals of
Theology and Jurisprudence, with their endless array of
abridgments, commentaries, and supercommentaries, possibly
the best known to European students are those by Abu
&#8217;l-Barak&aacute;t al-Nasaf&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1310), &#8216;A&#7693;udu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-&Iacute;j&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1355),
S&iacute;d&iacute; Khal&iacute;l al-Jund&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1365), Taft&aacute;z&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1389), Shar&iacute;f
al-Jurj&aacute;n&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1413), and Mu&#7717;ammad b. Y&uacute;suf al-San&uacute;s&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1486).
For Philology and Lexicography we have the <i>Alfiyya</i>, a
versified grammar by Ibn M&aacute;lik of Jaen (&#8224;&nbsp;1273); the
<i>&Aacute;jurr&uacute;miyya</i> on the rudiments of grammar, an exceedingly
popular compendium by &#7778;anh&aacute;j&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1323); and two famous
Arabic dictionaries, the <i>Lis&aacute;nu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab</i> by Jam&aacute;lu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Ibn
Mukarram (&#8224;&nbsp;1311), and the <i>Q&aacute;m&uacute;s</i> by F&iacute;r&uacute;z&aacute;b&aacute;d&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;1414).
Nor, although he was a Turk, should we leave unnoticed the
great bibliographer &#7716;&aacute;jj&iacute; Khal&iacute;fa (&#8224;&nbsp;1658), whose <i>Kashfu
&#8217;l-&#7826;un&uacute;n</i> contains the titles, arranged alphabetically, of all
the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish books of which the
existence was known to him.</p>

<p class="tb">The Mameluke period gave final shape to the <i>Alf Layla
wa-Layla</i>, or 'Thousand and One Nights,' a work which is
far more popular in Europe than the Koran or any other masterpiece
of Arabic literature. The modern title, 'Arabian Nights,'
tells only a part of the truth. Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute; (&#8224;&nbsp;956 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) mentions

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_457" id="Page_457" href="#"><span><i>THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS</i></span>457</a></span>

an old Persian book, the <i>Haz&aacute;r Afs&aacute;na</i> ('Thousand Tales')
which "is generally called the Thousand and One Nights; it
is the story of the King and his Vizier, and of the <span class="sidenote"> The 'Thousand
and One Nights.'</span>
Vizier's daughter and her slave-girl: Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z&aacute;d and
D&iacute;n&aacute;z&aacute;d."<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> The author of the <i>Fihrist</i>, writing
in 988 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, begins his chapter "concerning the Story-Tellers
and the Fabulists and the names of the books which they
composed" with the following passage (p. 304):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The first who composed fables and made books of them and put
them by in treasuries and sometimes introduced animals as speaking
<span class="sidenote"> Persian origin
of the 'Thousand
and One
Nights.'</span>
them were the Ancient Persians. Afterwards the
Parthian kings, who form the third dynasty of the
kings of Persia, showed the utmost zeal in this matter.
Then in the days of the S&aacute;s&aacute;nian kings such books
became numerous and abundant, and the Arabs translated them
into the Arabic tongue, and they soon reached the hands of philologists
and rhetoricians, who corrected and embellished them and
composed other books in the same style. Now the first book ever
made on this subject was the Book of the Thousand Tales (<i>Haz&aacute;r
Afs&aacute;n</i>), on the following occasion: A certain king of Persia used
to marry a woman for one night and kill her the next morning.
And he wedded a wise and clever princess, called Shahr&aacute;z&aacute;d, who
began to tell him stories and brought the tale at daybreak to a point
that induced the king to spare her life and ask her on the second
night to finish her tale. So she continued until a thousand nights
had passed, and she was blessed with a son by him.... And the
king had a stewardess (<i>qahram&aacute;na</i>) named D&iacute;n&aacute;rz&aacute;d, who was in
league with the queen. It is also said that this book was composed
for &#7716;um&aacute;n&iacute;, the daughter of Bahman, and there are various traditions
concerning it. The truth, if God will, is that Alexander (the
Great) was the first who heard stories by night, and <span class="sidenote">The <i>Haz&aacute;r
Afs&aacute;n</i>.</span>
he had people to make him laugh and divert him with
tales; although he did not seek amusement therein,
but only to store and preserve them (in his memory). The kings
who came after him used the 'Thousand Tales' (<i>Haz&aacute;r Afs&aacute;n</i>) for this

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_458" id="Page_458" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>458</a></span>

purpose. It covers a space of one thousand nights, but contains
less than two hundred stories, because the telling of a single story
often takes several nights. I have seen the complete work more
than once, and it is indeed a vulgar, insipid book (<i>kit&aacute;b<sup>un</sup> ghathth<sup>un</sup>
b&aacute;ridu &#8217;l-had&iacute;th</i>).<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a></p>

<p>Abu &#8216;Abdall&aacute;h Mu&#7717;ammad b. &#8216;Abd&uacute;s al-Jahshiy&aacute;r&iacute; (&#8224;942-943 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
the author of the 'Book of Viziers,' began to compile a book in
which he selected one thousand stories of the Arabs, the Persians,
the Greeks, and other peoples, every piece being independent
and unconnected with the rest. He gathered the story-tellers round
him and took from them the best of what they knew and were able
to tell, and he chose out of the fable and story-books whatever
pleased him. He was a skilful craftsman, so he put together from
this material 480 nights, each night an entire story of fifty pages,
more or less, but death surprised him before he completed the
thousand tales as he had intended."</p></div>

<p>Evidently, then, the <i>Haz&aacute;r Afs&aacute;n</i> was the kernel of the
'Arabian Nights,' and it is probable that this Persian
archetype included the most finely imaginative
tales in the existing collection, <i>e.g.</i>, the 'Fisherman
and the Genie,' 'Camaralzam&aacute;n and <span class="sidenote"> Different sources
of the collection.</span>
Bud&uacute;r,' and the 'Enchanted Horse.' As time went on, the
original stock received large additions which may be divided
into two principal groups, both Semitic in character: the one
belonging to Baghd&aacute;d and consisting mainly of humorous
anecdotes and love romances in which the famous Caliph
'Haroun Alraschid' frequently comes on the scene; the
other having its centre in Cairo, and marked by a roguish,
ironical pleasantry as well as by the mechanic supernaturalism
which is perfectly illustrated in 'Aladdin and the Wonderful
Lamp.' But, apart from these three sources, the 'Arabian
Nights' has in the course of centuries accumulated and
absorbed an immense number of Oriental folk-tales of every
description, equally various in origin and style. The oldest
translation by Galland (Paris, 1704-1717) is a charming

paraphrase, which in some respects is more true to the spirit of
the original than are the scholarly renderings of Lane and
Burton.</p>

<p>The 'Romance of &#8216;Antar' (<i>S&iacute;ratu &#8216;Antar</i>) is traditionally
ascribed to the great philologist, A&#7779;ma&#8216;&iacute;,<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> who flourished in
the reign of H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rash&iacute;d, but this must be considered
as an invention of the professional reciters <span class="sidenote">The 'Romance

who sit in front of Oriental caf&eacute;s and entertain
the public with their lively declamations.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> According to
Brockelmann, the work in its present form apparently dates
from the time of the Crusades.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> Its hero is the celebrated
heathen poet and warrior, &#8216;Antara b. Shadd&aacute;d, of whom we
have already given an account as author of one of the seven
<i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i>. Though the Romance exhibits all the
anachronisms and exaggerations of popular legend, it does
nevertheless portray the unchanging features of Bedouin life
with admirable fidelity and picturesqueness. Von Hammer,
whose notice in the <i>Mines de l'Orient</i> (1802) was the means
of introducing the <i>S&iacute;ratu &#8216;Antar</i> to European readers, justly
remarks that it cannot be translated in full owing to its
portentous length. It exists in two recensions called respectively
the Arabian (<i>&#7716;ij&aacute;ziyya</i>) and the Syrian (<i>Sh&aacute;miyya</i>), the
latter being very much curtailed.<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a></p>

these centuries was immediately caused by unfavourable social
and political conditions, the real source of the malady lay
deeper, and must, I think, be referred to the spiritual
paralysis which had long been creeping over <span class="sidenote"> Orthodoxy and
mysticism.</span>
Islam and which manifested itself by the complete
victory of the Ash&#8216;arites or Scholastic Theologians about
1200 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Philosophy and Rationalism were henceforth as
good as dead. Two parties remained in possession of the field&mdash;the
orthodox and the mystics. The former were naturally
intolerant of anything approaching to free-thought, and in
their principle of <i>ijm&aacute;&#8216;</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the consensus of public opinion
(which was practically controlled by themselves), they found a
potent weapon against heresy. How ruthlessly they sometimes
used it we may see from the following passage in the
<i>Yaw&aacute;q&iacute;t</i> of Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute;. After giving instances of the persecution
to which the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of old&mdash;B&aacute;yaz&iacute;d, Dh&uacute; &#8217;l-N&uacute;n, and
others&mdash;were subjected by their implacable enemies, the
<i>&#8216;Ulam&aacute;</i>, he goes on to speak of what had happened more
recently<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They brought the Im&aacute;m Ab&uacute; Bakr al-N&aacute;bulus&iacute;, notwithstanding
his merit and profound learning and rectitude in religion, from the

Maghrib to Egypt and testified that he was a heretic
(<i>zind&iacute;q</i>). The Sultan gave orders that he should be
suspended by his feet and flayed alive. While the
sentence was being carried out, he began to recite the Koran with
such an attentive and humble demeanour that he moved the hearts
of the people, and they were near making a riot. And likewise they
caused Nas&iacute;m&iacute; to be flayed at Aleppo.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> When he silenced them by

his arguments, they devised a plan for his destruction, thus: They
wrote the <i>S&uacute;ratu &#8217;l-Ikhl&aacute;&#7779;</i><a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> on a piece of paper and bribed a cobbler
of shoes, saying to him, 'It contains only love and pleasantness,
so place it inside the sole of the shoe.' Then they took that shoe
and sent it from a far distance as a gift to the Shaykh (Nas&iacute;m&iacute;), who
put it on, for he knew not. His adversaries went to the governor
of Aleppo and said: 'We have sure information that Nas&iacute;m&iacute; has
written, <i>Say, God is One</i>, and has placed the writing in the sole of
his shoe. If you do not believe us, send for him and see!' The
governor did as they wished. On the production of the paper, the
Shaykh resigned himself to the will of God and made no answer to
the charge, knowing well that he would be killed on that pretext.
I was told by one who studied under his disciples that all the time
when he was being flayed Nas&iacute;m&iacute; was reciting <i>muwashsha&#7717;s</i> in
praise of the Unity of God, until he composed five hundred verses,
and that he was looking at his executioners and smiling. And likewise
they brought Shaykh Abu &#8217;l-&#7716;asan al-Sh&aacute;dhil&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> from the West
to Egypt and bore witness that he was a heretic, but God delivered
him from their plots. And they accused Shaykh &#8216;Izzu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n b.
&#8216;Abd al-Sal&aacute;m<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> of infidelity and sat in judgment over him on
account of some expressions in his <i>&#8216;Aq&iacute;da</i> (Articles of Faith) and
urged the Sultan to punish him; afterwards, however, he was
restored to favour. They denounced Shaykh T&aacute;ju &#8217;l-D&iacute;n al-Subk&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a>
on the same charge, asserting that he held it lawful to drink wine
and that he wore at night the badge (<i>ghiy&aacute;r</i>) of the unbelievers and
the zone (<i>zunn&aacute;r</i>)<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a>; and they brought him, manacled and in chains,
from Syria to Egypt."</p></div>

<p>This picture is too highly coloured. It must be admitted
for the credit of the <i>&#8216;Ulam&aacute;</i>, that they seldom resorted
to violence. Islam was happily spared the horrors of an
organised Inquisition. On the other hand, their authority was

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_462" id="Page_462" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>462</a></span>

now so firmly established that all progress towards moral and
intellectual liberty had apparently ceased, or at any rate only
betrayed itself in spasmodic outbursts. &#7778;&uacute;fiism in some degree
represented such a movement, but the mystics shared the
triumph of Scholasticism and contributed to the reaction which
ensued. No longer an oppressed minority struggling for
toleration, they found themselves side by side with reverend
doctors on a platform broad enough to accommodate all
parties, and they saw their own popular heroes turned into
Saints of the orthodox Church. The compromise did not
always work smoothly&mdash;in fact, there was continual friction&mdash;but
on the whole it seems to have borne the strain wonderfully
well. If pious souls were shocked by the lawlessness of
the Dervishes, and if bigots would fain have burned the books of
Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; and Ibnu &#8217;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, the divines in general showed
a disposition to suspend judgment in matters touching holy
men and to regard them as standing above human criticism.</p>

<p class="tb">As typical representatives of the religious life of this
period we may take two men belonging to widely opposite
camps&mdash;Taqiyyu &#8217;l-D&iacute;n Ibn Taymiyya and &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Wahh&aacute;b
al-Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute;.</p>

<p>Ibn Taymiyya was born at &#7716;arr&aacute;n in 1263 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> A few
years later his father, fleeing before the Mongols, brought him
<span class="sidenote">Ibn Taymiyya
(1263-1328 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
to Damascus, where in due course he received an
excellent education. It is said that he never
forgot anything which he had once learned, and
his knowledge of theology and law was so extensive as almost
to justify the saying, "A tradition that Ibn Taymiyya does
not recognise is no tradition." Himself a &#7716;anbalite of the
deepest dye&mdash;holding, in other words, that the Koran must be
interpreted according to its letter and not by the light of
reason&mdash;he devoted his life with rare courage to the work of
religious reform. His aim, in short, was to restore the primitive
monotheism taught by the Prophet and to purge Islam

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_463" id="Page_463" href="#"><span><i>IBN TAYMIYYA</i></span>463</a></span>

of the heresies and corruptions which threatened to destroy it.
One may imagine what a hornet's nest he was attacking.
Mystics, philosophers, and scholastic theologians, all fell alike
under the lash of his denunciation. Bowing to no authority,
but drawing his arguments from the traditions and practice of
the early Church, he expressed his convictions in the most
forcible terms, without regard to consequences. Although
several times thrown into prison, he could not be muzzled for
long. The climax was reached when he lifted up his voice
against the superstitions of the popular faith&mdash;saint-worship,
pilgrimage to holy shrines, vows, offerings, and invocations.
These things, which the zealous puritan condemned as sheer
idolatry, were part of a venerable cult that was hallowed by
ancient custom, and had engrafted itself in luxuriant overgrowth
upon Islam. The mass of Moslems believed, and still
believe implicitly in the saints, accept their miracles, adore
their relics, visit their tombs, and pray for their intercession.
Ibn Taymiyya even declared that it was wrong to implore the
aid of the Prophet or to make a pilgrimage to his sepulchre.
It was a vain protest. He ended his days in captivity at
Damascus. The vast crowds who attended his funeral&mdash;we
are told that there were present 200,000 men and 15,000
women&mdash;bore witness to the profound respect which was
universally felt for the intrepid reformer. Oddly enough, he
was buried in the Cemetery of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, whose doctrines he had
so bitterly opposed, and the multitude revered his memory&mdash;as
a saint! The principles which inspired Ibn Taymiyya did not
fall to the ground, although their immediate effect was confined
to a very small circle. We shall see them reappearing victoriously
in the Wahh&aacute;bite movement of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class="tb">Notwithstanding the brilliant effort of Ghaz&aacute;l&iacute; to harmonise
dogmatic theology with mysticism, it soon became clear that
the two parties were in essence irreconcilable. The orthodox
clergy who held fast by the authority of the Koran and the>

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_464" id="Page_464" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>464</a></span>

Traditions saw a grave danger to themselves in the esoteric
revelation which the mystics claimed to possess; while the
latter, though externally conforming to the law of Islam,
looked down with contempt on the idea that true knowledge
of God could be derived from theology, or from any source
except the inner light of heavenly inspiration. Hence the
antithesis of <i>faq&iacute;h</i> (theologian) and <i>faq&iacute;r</i> (dervish), the one
class forming a powerful official hierarchy in close alliance with
the Government, whereas the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s found their chief support
among the people at large, and especially among the poor.
We need not dwell further on the natural antagonism which
has always existed between these rival corporations, and which
is a marked feature in the modern history of Islam. It will be
more instructive to spend a few moments with the last great
Mu&#7717;ammadan theosophist, &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Wahh&aacute;b <span class="sidenote">Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute;
&#8224;&nbsp;1565 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>).</span>
al-Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute;, a man who, with all his weaknesses,
was an original thinker, and exerted an influence
strongly felt to this day, as is shown by the steady demand for
his books. He was born about the beginning of the sixteenth
century. Concerning his outward life we have little information
beyond the facts that he was a weaver by trade and resided
in Cairo. At this time Egypt was a province of the Ottoman
Empire. Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute; contrasts the miserable lot of the peasantry
under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> with their comparative prosperity under
the Mamelukes. So terrible were the exactions of the tax-gatherers
that the fellah was forced to sell the whole produce
of his land, and sometimes even the ox which ploughed it, in
order to save himself and his family from imprisonment; and
every lucrative business was crushed by confiscation. It is
not to be supposed, however, that Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute; gave serious attention
to such sublunary matters. He lived in a world of
visions and wonderful experiences. He conversed with angels
and prophets, like his more famous predecessor, Mu&#7717;yi &#8217;l-D&iacute;n
Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute;, whose <i>Meccan Revelations</i> he studied and
epitomised. His autobiography entitled <i>La&#7789;&aacute;&#8217;ifu &#8217;l-Minan</i>

displays the hierophant in full dress. It is a record of the
singular spiritual gifts and virtues with which he was endowed,
and would rank as a masterpiece of shameless self-laudation,
did not the author repeatedly assure us that all his extraordinary
qualities are Divine blessings and are gratefully set
forth by their recipient <i>ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>. We should
be treating Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute; very unfairly if we judged him by this
work alone. The arrogant miracle-monger was one of the
most learned men of his day, and could beat the scholastic
theologians with their own weapons. Indeed, he regarded
theology (<i>fiqh</i>) as the first step towards &#7778;&uacute;fiism, and endeavoured
to show that in reality they are different aspects of the
same science. He also sought to harmonise the four great
schools of law, whose disagreement was consecrated by the
well-known saying ascribed to the Prophet: "The variance
of my people is an act of Divine mercy" (<i>ikhtil&aacute;fu ummat&iacute;
ra&#7717;mat<sup>un</sup></i>). Like the Arabian &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s generally, Sha&#8216;r&aacute;n&iacute; kept his
mysticism within narrow bounds, and declared himself an
adherent of the moderate section which follows Junayd of
Baghd&aacute;d (&#8224;&nbsp;909-910 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). For all his extravagant pretensions
and childish belief in the supernatural, he never lost touch with
the Mu&#7717;ammadan Church.</p>

<p class="tb">In the thirteenth century Ibn Taymiyya had tried to
eradicate the abuses which obscured the simple creed of Islam.
He failed, but his work was carried on by others and was

Arabia. In his youth he visited the principal cities of the
<span class="sidenote">Mu&#7717;ammad b.
&#8216;Abd al-Wahh&aacute;b
and his
successors.</span>
East, "as is much the practice with his countrymen
even now,"<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> and what he observed in the
course of his travels convinced him that Islam was
thoroughly corrupt. Fired by the example of Ibn Taymiyya,
whose writings he copied with his own hand,<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> Ibn &#8216;Abd
al-Wahh&aacute;b determined to re-establish the pure religion of
Mu&#7717;ammad in its primitive form. Accordingly he returned
home and retired with his family to &#7692;ira&#8216;iyya at the time when
Mu&#7717;ammad b. Sa&#8216;&uacute;d was the chief personage of the town.
This man became his first convert and soon after married his
daughter. But it was not until the end of the eighteenth century
that the Wahh&aacute;b&iacute;s, under &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-&#8216;Az&iacute;z, son of Mu&#7717;ammad
b. Sa&#8216;&uacute;d, gained their first great successes. In 1801 they sacked
Im&aacute;m-&#7716;usayn,<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> a town in the vicinity of Baghd&aacute;d, massacred
five thousand persons, and destroyed the cupola of &#7716;usayn's
tomb; the veneration paid by all Sh&iacute;&#8216;ites to that shrine being,
as Burckhardt says, a sufficient cause to attract the Wahh&aacute;b&iacute;
fury against it. Two years later they made themselves
masters of the whole &#7716;ij&aacute;z, including Mecca and Med&iacute;na.
On the death of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-&#8216;Az&iacute;z, who was assassinated in the
same year, his eldest son, Sa&#8216;&uacute;d, continued the work of conquest
and brought the greater part of Arabia under Wahh&aacute;bite rule.
At last, in 1811, Turkey despatched a fleet and army to recover
the Holy Cities. This task was accomplished by Mu&#7717;ammad
&#8216;Al&iacute;, the Pasha of Egypt (1812-13), and after five years' hard
fighting the war ended in favour of the Turks, who in 1818
inflicted a severe defeat on the Wahh&aacute;b&iacute;s and took their
capital, &#7692;ira&#8216;iyya, by storm. The sect, however, still maintains

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_467" id="Page_467" href="#"><span><i>THE WAHHABITE REFORMATION</i></span>467</a></span>

its power in Central Arabia, and in recent times has acquired
political importance.</p>

<p>The Wahh&aacute;b&iacute;s were regarded by the Turks as infidels and
authors of a new religion. It was natural that they should
<span class="sidenote"> The Wahh&aacute;bite
Reformation.</span>
appear in this light, for they interrupted the
pilgrim-caravans, demolished the domes and
ornamented tombs of the most venerable Saints
(not excepting that of the Prophet himself), and broke to
pieces the Black Stone in the Ka&#8216;ba. All this they did not as
innovators, but as reformers. They resembled the Carmathians
only in their acts. Burckhardt says very truly: "Not
a single new precept was to be found in the Wahaby code.
Abd el Wah&aacute;b took as his sole guide the Koran and the Sunne
(or the laws formed upon the traditions of Mohammed); and
the only difference between his sect and the orthodox Turks,
however improperly so termed, is, that the Wahabys rigidly
follow the same laws which the others neglect, or have ceased
altogether to observe."<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> "The Wahh&aacute;bites," says Dozy,
"attacked the idolatrous worship of Mahomet; although he
was in their eyes a Prophet sent to declare the will of God, he
was no less a man like others, and his mortal shell, far from
having mounted to heaven, rested in the tomb at Med&iacute;na.
Saint-worship they combated just as strongly. They proclaimed
that all men are equal before God; that even the
most virtuous and devout cannot intercede with Him; and
that, consequently, it is a sin to invoke the Saints and to adore
their relics."<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> In the same puritan spirit they forbade the
smoking of tobacco, the wearing of gaudy robes, and praying
over the rosary. "It has been stated that they likewise prohibited
the drinking of coffee; this, however, is not the fact:
they have always used it to an immoderate degree."<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a></p>

<p>The Wahh&aacute;bite movement has been compared with the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_468" id="Page_468" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>468</a></span>

Protestant Reformation in Europe; but while the latter was
followed by the English and French Revolutions, the former
has not yet produced any great political results. It has borne
fruit in a general religious revival throughout the world of
Islam and particularly in the mysterious San&uacute;siyya
<span class="sidenote"> The San&uacute;s&iacute;s in
Africa.</span>Brotherhood, whose influence is supreme in
Tripoli, the Sahara, and the whole North
African Hinterland, and whose members are reckoned by
millions. Mu&#7717;ammad b. &#8216;Al&iacute; b. San&uacute;s&iacute;, the founder of this
vast and formidable organisation, was born at Algiers in 1791,
lived for many years at Mecca, and died at Jaghb&uacute;b in
the Libyan desert, midway between Egypt and Tripoli, in
1859. Concerning the real aims of the San&uacute;s&iacute;s I must refer
the reader to an interesting paper by the Rev. E. Sell (<i>Essays
on Islam</i>, p. 127 sqq.). There is no doubt that they are
utterly opposed to all Western and modern civilisation, and
seek to regenerate Islam by establishing an independent theocratic
State on the model of that which the Prophet and his
successors called into being at Med&iacute;na in the seventh century
after Christ.</p>

<p class="tb">Since Napoleon showed the way by his expedition to Egypt in
1798, the Moslems in that country, as likewise in Syria and North
<span class="sidenote"> Islam and
modern civilisation.</span>
Africa, have come more and more under European
influence.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> The above-mentioned Mu&#7717;ammad
&#8216;Al&iacute;, who founded the Khedivial dynasty, and his
successors were fully alive to the practical benefits which might
be obtained from the superior culture of the West, and although
their policy in this respect was marked by greater zeal than
discretion, they did not exert themselves altogether in vain.
The introduction of the printing-press in 1821 was an epoch-making
measure. If, on the one hand, the publication of

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_469" id="Page_469" href="#"><span><i>INFLUENCE OF EUROPEAN CULTURE</i></span>469</a></span>

many classical works, which had well-nigh fallen into oblivion,
rekindled the enthusiasm of the Arabs for their national literature,
the cause of progress&mdash;I use the word without prejudice&mdash;has
been furthered by the numerous political, literary, and
scientific journals which are now regularly issued in every
country where Arabic is spoken.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> Besides these ephemeral
sheets, books of all sorts, old and new, have been multiplied by
the native and European presses of Cairo, B&uacute;l&aacute;q, and Beyrout.
The science and culture of Europe have been rendered
accessible in translations and adaptations of which the complete
list would form a volume in itself. Thus, an Arab may read
in his own language the tragedies of Racine, the comedies of
Moli&egrave;re,<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> the fables of La Fontaine, 'Paul and Virginia,' the
'Talisman,' 'Monte Cristo' (not to mention scores of minor
romances), and even the Iliad of Homer.<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> Parallel to this
imitative activity, we see a vigorous and growing movement
away from the literary models of the past. "Neo-Arabic
literature is only to a limited extent the heir of the old 'classical'
Arabic literature, and even shows a tendency to repudiate its
inheritance entirely. Its leaders are for the most part men
who have drunk from other springs and look at the world with
different eyes. Yet the past still plays a part in their intellectual
background, and there is a section amongst them upon whom
that past retains a hold scarcely shaken by newer influences.
For many decades the partisans of the 'old' and the 'new' have
engaged in a struggle for the soul of the Arabic world, a struggle
in which the victory of one side over the other is even yet not
assured. The protagonists are (to classify them roughly for
practical purposes) the European-educated classes of Egyptians
and Syrians on the one hand, and those in Egypt and the less
advanced Arabic lands whose education has followed traditional

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_470" id="Page_470" href="#"><span><i>THE MONGOL INVASION AND AFTER</i></span>470</a></span>

lines on the other. Whatever the ultimate result may be, there
can be no question that the conflict has torn the Arabic world
from its ancient moorings, and that the contemporary literature
of Egypt and Syria breathes in its more recent developments a
spirit foreign to the old traditions."<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a></p>

<p>Hitherto Western culture has only touched the surface of
Islam. Whether it will eventually strike deeper and penetrate
the inmost barriers of that scholastic discipline and literary
tradition which are so firmly rooted in the affections of the
Moslem peoples, or whether it will always remain an exotic
and highly-prized accomplishment of the enlightened and
emancipated few, but an object of scorn and detestation to
Mu&#7717;ammadans in general&mdash;these are questions that may not
be fully solved for centuries to come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Past affords an ample and splendid field of
study.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_xxii">P. xxii,</a> l. 2. Arabic begins to appear in North Arabian inscriptions

is one, of which the probable date is 268 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, published by Jaussen
and Savignac (<i>Mission arch&eacute;ologique en l'Arabie</i>, vol. i, p. 172).
Though it is written in Aramaic characters, nearly all the words
are Arabic, as may be seen from the transcription given by Professor
Horovitz in <i>Islamic Culture</i> (Hyderabad, <i>Deccan</i>), April
1929, vol. iii, No. 2, p. 169, note 2.</p>

a great deal of valuable information will be found in
the article <i>Saba&#8217;</i> by J. Tkatsch in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia of Islam</i>.

discoveries of E. Glaser, who, in the course of four journeys
(1882-94), collected over 2000 inscriptions. See also D. Nielsen,

<p><a href="#Page_133">P. 133</a>. As regards the authenticity of the Pre-islamic poems
which have come down to us, the observations of one of the
greatest authorities on the subject, the late Sir Charles J. Lyall,
seem to me to be eminently judicious (Introduction to the

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_472" id="Page_472" href="#"><span><i>APPENDIX</i></span>472</a></span>

<i>Mufa&#7693;&#7693;al&#299;y&#257;t</i>, vol. ii, pp. xvi-xxvi). He concludes that "upon
the whole, the impression which a close study of these ancient
relics gives is that we must take them, generally speaking, as the
production of the men whose names they bear." All that can
be urged against this view has been said with his usual learning
by Professor Margoliouth (<i>The Origins of Arabic Poetry, J.R.A.S.</i>,
1925, p. 417 foll.).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_145">P. 145</a>, l. 2. The oldest extant commentary on the Koran is
that of Bukh&aacute;r&iacute; in ch. 65 of the <i>&#7778;a&#7717;&iacute;&#7717;</i>, ed. Krehl, vol. iii, pp.
193-390.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_146">P. 146</a>, note 2. Recent investigators (Caetani and Lammens)
are far more sceptical. Cf. Snouck Hurgronje, <i>Mohammedanism</i>,
p. 22 foll.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_152">P. 152</a>, note 5. As suggested by Mr Richard Bell (<i>The Origin
of Islam in its Christian environment</i>, p. 88), the word <i>rujz</i> is in
all likelihood identical with the Syriac <i>rugza</i>, wrath, so that this
verse of the Koran means, "Flee from the wrath to come."</p>

<p><a href="#Page_170">P. 170</a>, l. 2 foll. This is one of the passages I should have liked
to omit. Even in its present form, it maintains a standpoint
which I have long regarded as mistaken.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_184">P. 184</a>, l. 4 foll. Professor Snouck Hurgronje (<i>Mohammedanism</i>,
p. 44) asks, "Was Mohammed conscious of the universality of his
mission?" and decides that he was not. I now agree that "in
the beginning he conceived his work as merely the Arabian part
of a universal task"&mdash;in which case <i>dhikr<sup>un</sup> li &#8217;l-&#8216;&aacute;lam&iacute;n</i> in the
passage quoted will mean "a warning to all the people (of Mecca
or Arabia)." But similar expressions in S&uacute;ras of the Medina
period carry, I think, a wider significance. The conception of
Islam as a world-religion is implied in Mohammed's later belief&mdash;he
only came to it gradually&mdash;that the Jewish and Christian
scriptures are corrupt and that the Koran alone represents the
original Faith which had been preached in turn by all the
prophets before him. And having arrived at that conviction,
he was not the man to leave others to act upon it.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_223">P. 223</a>, l. 9. In an article which appeared in the <i>Rivista degli
studi orientali</i>, 1916, p. 429 foll., Professor C. A. Nallino has shown
that this account of the origin of the name "Mu&#8216;tazilite" is
erroneous. The word, as Mas&#8216;&uacute;d&iacute; says (<i>Mur&uacute;ju &#8217;l-Dhahab</i>, vol. vi,
p. 22, and vol. vii, p. 234), is derived from <i>i&#8216;tiz&aacute;l</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the doctrine
that anyone who commits a capital sin has thereby withdrawn
himself (<i>i&#8216;tazala</i>) from the true believers and taken a position
(described as <i>fisq</i>, impiety) midway between them and the infidels.
According to the Murjites, such a person was still a true believer,
while their opponents, the Wa&#8216;&iacute;dites, and also the Kh&aacute;rijites,
held him to be an unbeliever.</p>

<a href="#Page_225">P. 225</a>, l. 1. The &#7716;ad&iacute;th, "No monkery (<i>rahb&aacute;niyya</i>) in Islam,"
probably dates from the third century of the Hijra. According
to the usual interpretation of Koran, LVII, 27, the <i>rahb&aacute;niyya</i>
practised by Christian ascetics is condemned as an innovation
not authorised by divine ordinance; but Professor Massignon
(<i>Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane</i>,
p. 123 foll.) shows that by some of the early Moslem commentators
and also by the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of the third century <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> this verse of the
Koran was taken as justifying and commending those Christians
who devoted themselves to the ascetic life, except in so far as they
had neglected to fulfil its obligations.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_228">P. 228</a> foll. It can now be stated with certainty that the name
"&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;" originated in K&uacute;fa in the second century <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> and was
at first confined to the mystics of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q. Hence the earliest development
of &#7778;&uacute;fiism, properly so called, took place in a hotbed
of Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite and Hellenistic (Christian and Gnostic) ideas.</p>

Miss Margaret Smith has given a scholarly and sympathetic
account of the life, legend, and teaching of this celebrated woman-saint.
The statement that she died and was buried at Jerusalem
is incorrect. Moslem writers have confused her with an earlier
saint of the same name, R&aacute;bi&#8216;a bint Ism&aacute;&#8216;&iacute;l (&#8224;&nbsp;135).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_367">P. 367</a>, l. 7 from foot. New light has recently been thrown
upon the character of the Mu&#8216;tazilite movement by the publication
of the Mu&#8216;tazilite al-Khayy&aacute;&#7789;'s <i>Kit&aacute;bu &#8217;l-Inti&#7779;&aacute;r</i> (ed. H. S.
Nyberg, Cairo, 1926), a third (ninth) century polemical work
directed against the Sh&iacute;&#8216;ite freethinker Ibnu &#8217;l-R&aacute;wand&iacute; (cf. p. 375
<i>supra</i>). It is now evident that this "heretical" sect played an
active part as champions of Islam, not only in the early controversies
which arose between Moslems and Christians in Syria but
also against the more dangerous attacks which proceeded in the
first hundred years of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid period from the Manich&aelig;ans
and other "<i>zan&aacute;diqa</i>" in Persia and especially in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q (cf.
I. Guidi, <i>La Lotta tra l'Islam e il Manicheismo</i> (Rome, 1927)).
In order to meet these adversaries on equal terms, the Mu&#8216;tazilites
made themselves acquainted with Greek philosophy and logic,
and thus laid the foundations of an Islamic scholasticism. Cf.
H. H. Schaeder, <i>Der Orient und die Griechische Erbe</i> in W. Jaeger's
<i>Die Antike</i>, vol. iv, p. 261 foll.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_370">P. 370</a>, I. 3 foll. From what has been said in the preceding
note it follows that this view of the relation between the Mu&#8216;tazilites
and the <i>Ikhw&aacute;nu &#8217;l-&#7778;af&aacute;</i> requires considerable modification. Although,
in contrast to their orthodox opponents, the Mu&#8216;tazilites
may be described as "rationalists" and "liberal theologians,"
their principles were entirely opposed to the anti-Islamic eclecticism
of the <i>Ikhw&aacute;n</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_375">P. 375</a>, note 2. Professor Schaeder thinks that Middle Persian
<i>zand&iacute;k</i> has nothing to do with the Aramaic <i>zadd&iacute;q</i> (<i>Z.D.M.G.</i>,
vol. 82, Heft 3-4, p. lxxx).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_383">Pp. 383-393</a>. During the last twenty years our knowledge of
early &#7778;&uacute;fiism has increased, chiefly through the profound researches
of Professor Massignon, to such an extent as to render
the account given in these pages altogether inadequate. The
subject being one of great difficulty and unsuitable for detailed
exposition in a book of this kind, I must content myself with a
few illustrative remarks and references, which will enable the
student to obtain further information.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_383">P. 383</a>. Massignon's view is that &#7778;&uacute;fiism (down to the fourth
century <span class="smcap">a.h.</span>) owed little to foreign influences and was fundamentally
Islamic, a product of intensive study of the Koran
and of inward meditation on its meaning and essential nature.
There is great force in his argument, though I cannot help
believing that the development of mysticism, like that of
other contemporary branches of Moslem thought, must have

<span class='pagenum'><a class="tooltip" name="Page_475" id="Page_475" href="#"><span><i>APPENDIX</i></span>475</a></span>

been vitally affected by contact with the ancient Hellenistic
culture of the S&aacute;s&aacute;nian and Byzantine empires on its native
soil. Cf. A. J. Wensinck, <i>The Book of the Dove</i> (Leyden,
1919) and <i>Mystic Treatises by Isaac of Niniveh</i> (Amsterdam,
1923).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_384">P. 384</a>, l. 1. The identity of third-century &#7778;&uacute;fiism with the
doctrines of the Vedanta is maintained by M. Horten (<i>Indische
Str&ouml;mungen in der Islamischen Mystik</i>, Heidelberg, 1927-8). Few,
however, would admit this. The conversion of &#7778;&uacute;fiism into a
monistic philosophy was the work of Ibnu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab&iacute; (1165-1240
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). See p. 402 foll.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_384">P. 384</a>, l. 5. The so-called "Theology of Aristotle," translated
from Syriac into Arabic about 830 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, is mainly an abstract of
the <i>Enneads</i> of Plotinus. There is an edition with German translation
by Dieterici.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_385">P. 385</a>, l. 11. All previous accounts of the development of
mystical doctrines in Islam during the first three centuries after
the Hijra have been superseded by Massignon's intimate analysis
(<i>Essai</i>, chs. iv and v, pp. 116-286), which includes biographies of
the eminent &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of that period and is based upon an amazingly
wide knowledge of original and mostly unpublished sources of
information. A useful summary of these two chapters is given
by Father Joseph Mar&eacute;chal in his <i>Studies in the Psychology of the
Mystics</i>, tr. Thorold (1927), pp. 241-9.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_399">P. 399</a>, note 1. With &#7716;all&aacute;j, thanks to the monumental work
of Massignon (<i>La Passion d'al-&#7716;all&aacute;j</i>, 2 vols., Paris, 1922), we
are now better acquainted than with any other Moslem mystic.
His doctrine exhibits some remarkable affinities with Christianity
and bears no traces of the pantheism attributed to him by later
&#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s as well as by Von Kremer and subsequent European writers.
Cf. the summary given by Father Joseph Mar&eacute;chal, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp.

<p><a href="#Page_456">P. 456</a>, l. 1 foll. Here, though he is out of place in such an

almost world-wide travels, entitled <i>Tu&#7717;fatu &#8217;l-Nu&#7827;&#7827;&aacute;r</i>, is described
by its latest translator, Mr H. A. R. Gibb, as "an authority for
the social and cultural history of post-Mongol Islam."</p>

Margoliouth in Hastings' <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia of Religion and Ethics</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_469">P. 469</a>. <i>La litt&eacute;rature arabe au xix<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle</i>, by L. Cheikho
(Beyrouth, 1908-10), which deals chiefly with the literature produced
by the Christian Arabs of Syria, deserves mention as one
of the few works on the subject written in a European language.
The influence of Western ideas on Moslem theology may be studied
in the <i>Ris&aacute;latu &#8217;l-tau&#7717;&iacute;d</i> of the great Egyptian divine, Mu&#7717;ammad
&#8216;Abduh (1842-1905), which has been translated into French by

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORKS BY<br />
EUROPEAN AUTHORS</h3>

<p>The following list is intended to give students of Arabic as well
as those who cannot read that language the means of obtaining
further information concerning the various topics which fall within
the scope of a work such as this. Since anything approaching to a
complete bibliography is out of the question, I have mentioned only
a few of the most important translations from Arabic into English,
French, German, and Latin; and I have omitted (1) monographs on
particular Arabic writers, whose names, together with the principal
European works relating to them, will be found in Brockelmann's
great History of Arabic Literature, and (2) a large number of books
and articles which appeal to specialists rather than to students.
Additional information is supplied by E. G. Browne in his <i>Literary
History of Persia</i>, vol. i, pp. 481-496, and D. B. Macdonald in his
<i>Development of Muslim Theology, etc.</i> (London, 1903), pp. 358-367,
while the Appendix to H. A. R. Gibb's <i>Arabic Literature</i> (Oxford
University Press, 1926) contains a well-chosen list of books of
reference and translations. Those who require more detailed
references may consult the <i>Bibliographie des ouvrages arabes ou
relatifs aux Arabes publ. dans l'Europe chr&eacute;tienne de 1810 &agrave; 1885</i>,
by V. Chauvin (Li&egrave;ge, 1892-1903), the <i>Orientalische Bibliographie</i>,
edited by A. M&uuml;ller, E. Kuhn, and L. Scherman (Berlin, 1887&mdash;),
the <i>Handbuch der Islam-Litteratur</i>, by D. G. Pfannm&uuml;ller (Berlin

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">55</span></a> Dhu &#8217;l-Qarnayn is described as "the measurer of the earth" (<i>Mass&aacute;&#7717;u
&#8217;l-ar&#7693;</i>) by Hamd&aacute;n&iacute;, <i>Jaz&iacute;ratu &#8217;l-&#8216;Arab</i>, p. 46, l. 10. If I may step for a
moment outside the province of literary history to discuss the mythology of
these verses, it seems to me more than probable that Dhu &#8217;l-Qarnayn is a
personification of the Sab&aelig;an divinity &#8216;Athtar, who represents "sweet
Hesper-Phosphor, double name" (see D. H. M&uuml;ller in <i>S.B.W.A.</i>, vol. 97,
p. 973 seq.). The Min&aelig;an inscriptions have "&#8216;Athtar of the setting and
&#8216;Athtar of the rising" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 1033). Moreover, in the older inscriptions
&#8216;Athtar and Almaqa are always mentioned together; and Almaqa, which
according to Hamd&aacute;n&iacute; is the name of Venus (<i>al-Zuhara</i>), was identified by
Arabian arch&aelig;ologists with Bilq&iacute;s. For <i>qarn</i> in the sense of 'ray' or
'beam' see Goldziher, <i>Abhand. zur Arab. Philologie</i>, Part I, p. 114. I
think there is little doubt that Dhu &#8217;l-Qarnayn and Bilq&iacute;s may be added to
the examples (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 111 sqq.) of that peculiar conversion by which many
heathen deities were enabled to maintain themselves under various disguises
within the pale of Islam.</p></div>

to me to be manifestly untenable. The reader will have no difficulty in
believing that this poem was meant to be recited by a wandering minstrel
to the hearers that gathered round him at nightfall. It may well be the
composition of one of those professional story-tellers who flourished in
the first century after the Flight, such as &#8216;Ab&iacute;d b. Sharya (see p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a> <i>supra</i>),

the fact that <i>ruqq&aacute;n</i> (plural of <i>raq&iacute;q</i>) is not mentioned by the lexicographers,

The incidental references to contemporary events in Syriac and Byzantine
writers, who often describe what they saw with their own eyes, are
extremely valuable as a means of fixing the chronology, which Arabian
historians can only supply by conjecture, owing to the want of a definite
era during the Pre-islamic period. Mu&#7717;ammadan general histories
usually contain sections, more or less mythical in character, "On the
Kings of &#7716;&iacute;ra and Ghass&aacute;n." Attention may be called in particular to the
account derived from Hish&aacute;m b. Mu&#7717;ammad al-Kalb&iacute;, which is preserved

an artistic purpose, but they differ as to the precise sense in which 'purpose'
is to be understood. Modern critics are equally at variance. Jacob
(<i>Stud. in Arab. Dichtern</i>, Heft III, p. 203) would derive the word from the
principal motive of these poems, namely, to gain a rich reward in return
for praise and flattery. Ahlwardt (<i>Bemerkungen &uuml;ber die Aechtheit der alten
Arab. Gedichte</i>, p. 24 seq.) connects it with <i>qa&#7779;ada, to break</i>, "because it
consists of verses, every one of which is divided into two halves, with a
common end-rhyme: thus the whole poem is <i>broken</i>, as it were, into two
halves;" while in the <i>Rajaz</i> verses, as we have seen (p. 74 <i>supra</i>), there

as replying to the Angel, "What am I to read?" (<i>m&aacute; aqra&#8217;u or m&aacute; dh&aacute;
aqra&#8217;u</i>). Professor Bevan has pointed out to me that the tradition in this
form bears a curious resemblance, which can hardly be accidental, to the
words of Isaiah xl. 6: "The voice said, Cry. And he said, What
shall I cry?" The question whether the Prophet could read and
write is discussed by N&ouml;ldeke (<i>Geschichte des Qor&acirc;ns</i>, p. 7 sqq.), who
leaves it undecided. According to N&ouml;ldeke (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 10), the
epithet <i>umm&iacute;</i>, which is applied to Mu&#7717;ammad in the Koran, and is
commonly rendered by 'illiterate,' does not signify that he was
ignorant of reading and writing, but only that he was unacquainted with
the ancient Scriptures; <i>cf.</i> 'Gentile.' However this may be, it appears that
he wished to pass for illiterate, with the object of confirming the belief in
his inspiration: "<i>Thou</i>" (Mu&#7717;ammad) "<i>didst not use to read any book
before this</i>" (the Koran) "<i>nor to write it with thy right hand; else the liars

the traditional interpretation supported by verses 4 and 5. Mu&#7717;ammad

the Heavenly Book which is the source of all Revelation.</p></div>

of God.' The participle, <i>Muslim</i> (Moslem), denotes one who thus surrenders
himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_303" id="Footnote_303"></a><a href="#FNanchor_303"><span class="label">303</span></a> It must be remembered that this branch of Mu&#7717;ammadan tradition
derives from the pietists of the first century after the Flight, who were
profoundly dissatisfied with the reigning dynasty (the Umayyads), and
revenged themselves by painting the behaviour of the Meccan ancestors of
the Umayyads towards Mu&#7717;ammad in the blackest colours possible. The
facts tell another story. It is significant that hardly any case of real
persecution is mentioned in the Koran. Mu&#7717;ammad was allowed to
remain at Mecca and to carry on, during many years, a religious
propaganda which his fellow-citizens, with few exceptions, regarded as
detestable and dangerous. We may well wonder at the moderation of
the Quraysh, which, however, was not so much deliberate policy as the
result of their indifference to religion and of Mu&#7717;ammad's failure to make
appreciable headway in Mecca.</p></div>

(<i>Abhandlungen der K&ouml;nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G&ouml;ttingen</i>,

that the oldest Kh&aacute;rijites were not true Bedouins (<i>A&#8216;r&aacute;b&iacute;</i>), and were, in
fact, even further removed than the rest of the military colonists of K&uacute;fa
and Ba&#7779;ra from their Bedouin traditions. He points out that the extreme
piety of the Readers&mdash;their constant prayers, vigils, and repetitions of the
Koran&mdash;exactly agrees with what is related of the Kh&aacute;rijites, and is
described in similar language. Moreover, among the oldest Kh&aacute;rijites
we find mention made of a company clad in long cloaks (<i>bar&aacute;nis</i>, pl. of
<i>burnus</i>), which were at that time a special mark of asceticism. Finally,
the earliest authority (Ab&uacute; Mikhnaf in &#7788;abar&iacute;, i, 3330, l. 6 sqq.) regards
the Kh&aacute;rijites as an offshoot from the Readers, and names individual

some colour to Ibn Sab&aacute;'s contention that it alluded to the return of

points out that this translation of <i>al-Saff&aacute;&#7717;</i>, although it has been generally
adopted by European scholars, is very doubtful. According to Professor
De Goeje, <i>al-Saff&aacute;&#7717;</i> means 'the munificent' (literally, 'pouring out' gifts,
&amp;c.). In any case it is important to notice that the name was given to
certain Pre-islamic chieftains. Thus Salama b. Kh&aacute;lid, who commanded
the Ban&uacute; Taghlib at the first battle of al-Kul&aacute;b (Ibnu &#8217;l-Ath&iacute;r, ed. by
Tornberg, vol. i, p. 406, last line), is said to have been called <i>al-Saff&aacute;&#7717;</i>
because he 'emptied out' the skin bottles (<i>maz&aacute;d</i>) of his army before a
battle (Ibn Durayd, ed. by W&uuml;stenfeld, p. 203, l. 16); and we find mention
of a poet named al-Saff&aacute;&#7717; b. &#8216;Abd Man&aacute;t (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 277, penult. line).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_481" id="Footnote_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_481"><span class="label">481</span></a> Professor De Goeje has kindly given me the following references :&mdash;&#7788;abar&iacute;,
ii, 78, l. 10, where Ziy&aacute;d is called the <i>Waz&iacute;r</i> of Mu&#8216;&aacute;wiya; Ibn
Sa&#8216;d, iii, 121, l. 6 (Ab&uacute; Bakr the <i>Waz&iacute;r</i> of the Prophet). The word occurs
in Pre-islamic poetry (Ibu Qutayba, <i>K. al-Shi&#8216;r wa-&#8217;l-Shu&#8216;ar&aacute;</i>, p. 414, l. 1).
Professor De Goeje adds that the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Caliphs gave the name <i>Waz&iacute;r</i>
as title to the minister who was formerly called <i>K&aacute;tib</i> (Secretary). Thus
it would seem that the Arabic <i>Waz&iacute;r</i> (literally 'burden-bearer'), who was
at first merely a 'helper' or 'henchman,' afterwards became the representative
and successor of the <i>Dap&iacute;r</i> (official scribe or secretary) of the
S&aacute;s&aacute;nian kings.</p></div>

In a strictly political sense, the period of decline begins thirty years
earlier with the Caliphate of Ma&#8217;m&uacute;n (813-833 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). The historian
Abu &#8217;l-Ma&#7717;&aacute;sin (&#8224;&nbsp;1469 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) dates the decline of the Caliphate from the
accession of Muktaf&iacute; in 902 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> (<i>al-Nuj&uacute;m al-Z&aacute;hira</i>, ed. by Juynboll,

The ascetic "lives the life of a king" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 187, l. 5). Contented men
are the noblest of all (p. 148, l. 2). So the great Persian mystic, Jal&aacute;lu
&#8217;l-D&iacute;n R&uacute;m&iacute;, says in reference to the perfect &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; (<i>D&iacute;v&aacute;n-i Shams-i Tabr&iacute;z</i>,
No. viii, v. 3 in my edition): <i>Mard-i khud&aacute; sh&aacute;h buvad z&iacute;r-i dalq</i>, "the
man of God is a king 'neath dervish-cloak;" and eminent spiritualists
are frequently described as "kings of the (mystic) path." I do not deny,
however, that this metaphor may have been originally suggested by the
story of Buddha.</p></div>

'veracious.' <i>Zadd&iacute;q</i> passed into Persian in the form <i>Zand&iacute;k</i>, which was
used by the Persians before Islam, and <i>Zind&iacute;q</i> is the Arabicised form of
the latter word. For some of these observations I am indebted to Professor
Bevan. Further details concerning the derivation and meaning of <i>Zind&iacute;q</i>

the famous Vizier of Granada, to which he prefixed a long and discursive
introduction in eight chapters: (1) Description of Spain; (2) Conquest of
Spain by the Arabs; (3) History of the Spanish dynasties; (4) Cordova;
(5) Spanish-Arabian scholars who travelled in the East; (6) Orientals who
visited Spain; (7) Miscellaneous extracts, anecdotes, poetical citations, &amp;c.,
bearing on the literary history of Spain; (8) Reconquest of Spain by the
Christians and expulsion of the Arabs. The whole work is entitled

serving in the harem or the army, without regard to their nationality. Like
the Mamelukes and Janissaries, they formed a privileged corps under the
patronage of the palace, and since the reign of &#8216;Abdu &#8217;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n III their

addition to the garrison proper, by individuals who, from pious motives,
wished to take part in the holy war (<i>jih&aacute;d</i>) against the unbelievers. The
word <i>mur&aacute;bi&#7789;</i>, therefore, gradually got an exclusively religious signification,

Tabr&iacute;z (he is generally said to be a native of Nas&iacute;m in the district of
Baghd&aacute;d), and observes that he resided in Aleppo, where his followers
were numerous and his heretical doctrines widely disseminated.</p></div>

<h3>>INDEX</h3>

<p><small>In the following Index it has been found necessary to omit the accents indicating the long
vowels, and the dots which are used in the text to distinguish letters of similar pronunciation.
On the other hand, the definite article <i>al</i> has been prefixed throughout to those Arabic names
which it properly precedes; it is sometimes written in full, but is generally denoted by a hyphen,
<i>e.g.</i> -&#8216;Abbas for al-&#8216;Abbas. Names of books, as well as Oriental words and technical terms explained
in the text, are printed in italics. Where a number of references occur under one heading,
the more important are, as a rule, shown by means of thicker type.</small></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
